Study how games create meaningful build diversity without overwhelming new players. Analyze: (1) Path of Exile's passive tree (complexity extreme), (2) Hades' Mirror of Night (elegant simplicity), (3) Diablo 4's paragon boards, (4) Vampire Survivors' power-ups. Focus on: unlock pacing, respec economics, build identity formation. Output: Docs/research/skill-tree-specialization.md
