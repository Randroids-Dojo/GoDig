Calibrate game feel 'juice' to medium level. Research (N=3018) shows both None and Extreme juice decrease play time - Medium/High is optimal. Implementation: progressive crack pattern on blocks, particle burst on break, subtle screen shake on hard blocks. Avoid over-juicing that causes stuttering or overwhelming feedback. Reference Session 29 game feel research.
