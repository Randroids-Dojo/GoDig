Study: (1) Pokemon GO's community days (inclusive design), (2) Fall Guys' seasons, (3) Clash Royale's river race fatigue, (4) Fortnite's Battle Pass FOMO criticism. Focus on: catch-up mechanics, replay value post-event, avoiding daily login pressure. Output: Docs/research/seasonal-events-no-fomo.md
