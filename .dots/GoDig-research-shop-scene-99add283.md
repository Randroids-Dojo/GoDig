How should the shop work? Need UI for selling inventory items. Questions: Is shop a separate scene or overlay? How does player access shop (return to surface, button)? How do sell prices map to OreData.sell_value? Should there be a 'sell all' button? How does InventoryManager integrate with shop transactions?
