## Purpose

Research dark patterns in mobile game onboarding that frustrate players and damage trust, to ensure GoDig avoids them.

## Research Questions

1. What tutorial dark patterns cause early churn?
2. How do predatory games manipulate the FTUE to push monetization?
3. What onboarding practices have player backlash?
4. How do ethical games build trust in the first session?
5. What's the line between guidance and manipulation?

## Dark Patterns to Avoid
- Forced tutorial length
- Fake difficulty to sell solutions
- Artificial time gates
- Hidden complexity
- Bait-and-switch mechanics

## Ethical Patterns to Emulate
- Respectful skip options
- Earned unlocks that feel fair
- Transparent mechanics
- Player-paced learning
- No FOMO pressure

## GoDig Application
- Tutorial pacing decisions
- When to introduce shop/monetization
- Progression transparency
- First upgrade feeling earned vs given

## Deliverable
