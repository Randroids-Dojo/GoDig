## Purpose

Deep analysis of our two newest competitors (Keep Digging Jan 2026, ITER 2025) to identify differentiation opportunities and potential borrowed mechanics.

## Keep Digging Analysis Questions

1. How does their 10-layer, 1000m depth progression feel?
2. What makes co-op mining work without our tension mechanics?
3. How do they handle the return trip without ladders?
4. What upgrade systems do they use (8 technology types)?
5. How does cross-progression (solo ↔ multiplayer) work?

## ITER Analysis Questions

1. How does 2D-to-3D dimension shifting affect mining feel?
2. What roguelite elements do they combine with mining?
3. How do "shifting dimensions" create tension?
4. What's their run length and loop structure?

## Competitive Positioning

| Feature | Keep Digging | ITER | GoDig |
|---------|--------------|------|-------|
| Core tension | Depth exploration | Dimensional shifts | Ladder economy |
| Multiplayer | 8-player co-op | Unknown | Single (v1.0) |
| Combat | None | Yes (survive) | Optional (v1.1) |
| Risk mechanic | Unknown | Dimension hazards | Resource depletion |
| Unique hook | Cozy co-op | 2D/3D puzzle | Push-your-luck |

## Research Tasks

- [ ] Watch Keep Digging gameplay videos
- [ ] Read Keep Digging Steam reviews for pain points
- [ ] Watch ITER trailer/gameplay when available
- [ ] Identify features we should adopt
- [ ] Identify features that dilute our core identity (avoid)

## Output

Create implementation specs for any borrowed mechanics that enhance our ladder-based tension system without diluting our unique identity.
