Study how solo mobile games implement healthy competition without toxicity. Analyze: (1) Alto's Odyssey daily challenges, (2) Crossy Road ghost comparisons, (3) Clash Royale's personal best focus, (4) Archero's weekly rankings. Focus on: async competition, friend-based vs global, preventing discouragement, seeding low-rank players fairly. Output: Docs/research/social-competition-single-player.md
