Research how successful roguelites handle player retreat and cargo preservation. Topics: 1) Loop Hero's retreat percentage system, 2) Hades' death mechanics and resource preservation, 3) Dead Cells' corpse runs, 4) When players should lose resources vs keep them, 5) The psychology of 'at least I kept something'. Output: Docs/research/retreat-preservation.md for retreat percentage implementation.
