Deep dive into player-controlled difficulty systems in roguelites and similar games. Study Hades Heat system, Slay the Spire Ascension, Dead Cells Boss Cells, and Risk of Rain Artifacts. Focus on: (1) How modifiers create replayability without gatekeeping content, (2) Reward psychology for optional difficulty, (3) Community engagement through challenge sharing, (4) Balance between skill expression and accessibility.
