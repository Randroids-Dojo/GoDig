Measure and optimize the core loop timing based on research findings. Target: 5-15 minute ideal sessions with natural stopping points.

## Key Findings from Research
- Dome Keeper: 2-3 minute cycles work well
- Idle games: 18% stickiness vs 10.5% for other hyper-casual
- Mining games: 'Just one more layer' psychology critical
- Full inventory should happen every 3-8 minutes early game

## Questions to Answer
1. How long does it take to fill 8 inventory slots at start?
2. How long is round-trip from surface to 50m?
3. When does first upgrade become affordable?
4. Are there 'dead zones' without meaningful upgrades?

## Deliverables
- Timing measurements for key actions
- Implementation dots for pacing adjustments
- Session flow diagram
