Research how games create meaningful inventory pressure. Topics: 1) Dome Keeper carrying capacity and movement speed tradeoff, 2) Spelunky's 1-item limit and strategic dropping, 3) Darkest Dungeon's loot vs supplies decision, 4) Visual feedback for inventory stress (UI changes), 5) When players enjoy vs resent inventory limits. Output: Docs/research/inventory-tension-patterns.md for tension visual system.
