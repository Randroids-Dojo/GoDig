Research milestone design and achievement psychology. Analyze: how games communicate progress milestones, what visual/audio cues create satisfaction, when milestones should unlock new content vs cosmetics, optimal spacing between meaningful milestones. Games to study: Hades heat system, Celeste chapter clear screens, Dark Souls bonfire feelings, Spelunky shortcut unlocks. Questions: How to make depth feel meaningful beyond numbers? What celebration level is appropriate (too much = annoying, too little = anticlimactic)?
