## Purpose

Investigate how games with color-coded layers/zones maintain accessibility for color-blind players. GoDig uses depth-based color palettes which must work for all players.

## Questions to Research

1. What color combinations are safe for common color blindness types?
2. How do games add secondary visual cues beyond color?
3. What patterns/textures help distinguish layers?
4. How do UI elements use shape + color for redundancy?
5. What testing approaches catch accessibility issues early?

## Sources to Check
- Color Oracle simulation tools
- Hollow Knight/Metroid Dread zone design
- Color-blind gaming accessibility guides
- Valve's TF2 color-blind solutions
- Dead Cells visual accessibility

## Output
Create Docs/research/colorblind-layer-accessibility.md with layer design recommendations.
