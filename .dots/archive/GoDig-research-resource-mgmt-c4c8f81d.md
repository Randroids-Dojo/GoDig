## Purpose

Investigate the psychology of resource hoarding and management anxiety in mining games. Players often over-prepare or under-use consumables - understand how to encourage healthy resource use.

## Questions to Research

1. Why do players hoard consumables (too-good-to-use syndrome)?
2. How do games encourage resource spending vs hoarding?
3. What inventory limits create healthy pressure without frustration?
4. How do escape items (teleport scrolls) get used or hoarded?
5. What signals encourage players to take risks with resources?

## Sources to Check
- Extra Credits on consumable hoarding
- RPG resource psychology studies
- Zelda resource management design
- Resident Evil item scarcity
- Fire Emblem permadeath + item use

## Output
Create Docs/research/resource-hoarding-psychology.md with design recommendations.
