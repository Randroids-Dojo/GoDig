# Mining Game Monetization Ethics

## Overview

This research examines monetization practices specifically in mining/digging games. Some patterns common in mobile gaming feel particularly exploitative in resource-collection games. The goal is to identify ethical monetization strategies that align with GoDig's player-first design philosophy.

## Genre-Specific Concerns

### Why Mining Games Are Different

Mining games create unique emotional dynamics that make certain monetization practices feel worse:

1. **Collection satisfaction** - Players derive joy from accumulating resources; selling progress directly undermines this
2. **Exploration ownership** - Players feel they "earned" discoveries; paying to skip exploration cheapens achievement
3. **Tool progression investment** - Upgrading tools represents personal growth; pay-to-upgrade bypasses the journey
4. **Resource anxiety** - Energy/fuel systems in mining games feel like "running out of air"

### The Fuel/Energy Problem

Energy mechanics in mining games carry extra psychological weight:
- **Motherload's fuel**: Acceptable because it's a gameplay mechanic, not monetization
- **Mobile mining games with purchasable fuel**: Feels like holding breath hostage
- **Time-gated mining**: Creates artificial scarcity in a genre about abundance

> "Time-gated mechanics enforce real-world time delays—such as cooldowns, energy restrictions, or building timers—to pace gameplay or encourage players to spend money to skip the wait." - This pattern directly conflicts with the satisfaction loop of mining games.

## Case Studies: Mining Game Monetization

### SteamWorld Dig Series (Premium)

**Model:** One-time purchase, no microtransactions
- Base game provides complete experience
- SteamWorld Dig 2 built on success with same approach
- Post-launch updates added value without charging
- Consistent pricing across platforms

**Why It Works:**
- Players feel ownership of complete experience
- No interruption to gameplay flow
- Word-of-mouth driven by goodwill
- Focus on quality over monetization hooks

### Dome Keeper (Premium + Cosmetic DLC)

**Model:** Premium base game ($17.99) + optional cosmetic DLC ($2.99 each)
- All gameplay content in base game
- DLC adds character skins and pets (dome decorations)
- Major content updates provided free
- Developer commitment: "No plans for additional paid content"

**Community Response:**
- Debate about value proposition vs. price
- Comparison to lower-priced games (Vampire Survivors)
- Supporters argue: "If $16 keeps an indie developer fed, that's money well spent"
- Cosmetic-only DLC well-received

**Key Insight:** Two-person team found sustainable model without predatory tactics.

### Terraria (Premium + Major Expansions)

**Model:** One-time purchase with massive free content updates
- Original price point maintained through years of updates
- No paid DLC (all updates free)
- Mobile version maintains same fair model
- Community goodwill translated to 44+ million copies sold

**Why It Works:**
- Players become evangelists
- Long-term engagement through content, not monetization pressure
- Modding community extends value further

### Deep Rock Galactic (Premium + Cosmetic Support)

**Model:** Base game + cosmetic DLC packs + free battle pass
- All weapons, missions, biomes included in base game
- DLC is purely cosmetic
- Battle pass is free and anti-FOMO (old items enter loot pool)
- Cosmetic DLC created at community request

**Community Quote:** "You get access to the whole game just by buying it, a rare spectacle these days!"

**Why It Works:**
- No FOMO tactics
- Paid cosmetics "pale in comparison" to free unlockables
- DLC supports development without gating content

## Predatory Patterns to Avoid

### Research-Identified Predatory Techniques

Academic research has categorized 35 separate predatory monetization techniques across eight domains:

| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Game dynamics designed to drive spending | Progress walls, artificial difficulty spikes |
| Product not meeting expectations | "Bait and switch" on launch |
| Monetisation of basic QoL | Paying for inventory space, save slots |
| Predatory advertising | Interstitial ads blocking gameplay |
| In-game currency obfuscation | Premium currency making real costs unclear |
| Pay to win | Purchasable stat advantages |
| FOMO tactics | Limited-time exclusive items |
| Loot boxes/gacha | Random rewards for real money |

### Documented Negative Outcomes

- **GeoGuessr Steam Edition**: 17% positive reviews due to aggressive monetization
- **Mecha Break**: "Mixed" reviews despite solid gameplay due to paywalled cosmetics
- **Blue Protocol**: "Heavy monetization and slow progression" cited as main complaints
- **General pattern**: Short-term revenue gains lead to long-term reputation damage

### Warning Signs

These practices signal exploitation:
- Energy that depletes faster than natural play would suggest
- "First hit free" mechanics (generous early, punishing later)
- Premium currency with confusing exchange rates
- Artificial difficulty spikes before purchase prompts
- Social mechanics that create spending pressure
- Limited-time offers creating FOMO

## Ethical Monetization Options for GoDig

### Recommended: Premium Model

**Why Premium Suits Mining Games:**
- Complete experience feels earned
- No interruption to flow state
- Aligns with genre expectations (SteamWorld, Terraria)
- Word-of-mouth marketing more effective
- Lower development complexity (no economy balancing for F2P)

**Suggested Implementation:**
```
Base Game: $4.99-$9.99 (mobile), $14.99-$19.99 (PC)
- All content included
- All upgrades earnable through play
- Complete experience with no gates
```

### Optional: Cosmetic DLC (Post-Launch)

**Acceptable Cosmetics:**
- Pickaxe skins (visual only, no stat changes)
- Character customization
- Surface building decorations
- Special visual effects (trail colors, mining particles)

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Announce DLC approach before launch (set expectations)
- Ensure base game has ample free cosmetic unlocks
- DLC should complement, not replace, earned content
- No "best" cosmetics locked behind payment

**Pricing Research:**
- War Robots found best-selling skins were cheapest ones
- Dome Keeper DLC at $2.99 well-received
- Deep Rock Galactic packs ~$7.99 for themed sets

### Avoid: Free-to-Play with IAP

**Why F2P Is Risky for Mining Games:**
- Energy mechanics feel hostile in resource-collection context
- Progress selling undermines core satisfaction
- Community expectations for mining games skew premium
- Balancing F2P economy adds significant development burden
- Reputation risk from perception of exploitation

**If F2P Is Necessary:**
- Cosmetic-only purchases
- No energy/stamina systems
- No purchasable resources or currency
- Remove all ads option as one-time purchase
- Generous free content (paid players should feel like supporters, not required spenders)

## Player Perception Research

### What Players Accept

| Acceptable | Unacceptable |
|------------|--------------|
| One-time purchase for full game | Energy systems |
| Cosmetic DLC after launch | Purchasable progression |
| Expansion packs with new content | Pay-to-skip mechanics |
| "Tip jar" style supporter packs | Loot boxes |
| Battle passes without FOMO | Time-limited exclusives |

### Steam Review Patterns

Games with "Very Positive" reviews consistently:
- Deliver complete experience at purchase
- Add free content updates
- Offer optional cosmetic purchases
- Respect player time and investment

Games with "Mixed" reviews often:
- Launch with incomplete content
- Add paid features that feel core
- Use time-gating or energy systems
- Have unclear pricing/currency
