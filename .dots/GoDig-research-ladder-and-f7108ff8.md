How do ladders work to escape tunnels? Questions: Are ladders bought from shop or crafted? How are they placed? (tap to place, auto-place?) How many does player carry? Can they be picked back up? Are there other traversal items? (rope, teleport scroll) How does climbing state work? What about the mine entrance on surface?
