## Purpose
Analyze Cairn's piton placement system as a model for player-defined checkpointing.

## Background
From Session 31 research, Cairn uses:
- Manual piton placement creates player-defined checkpoints
- Falls reset to last piton, not start
- Stamina management creates risk around placement timing
- 200K+ copies in 4 days validates the approach

## Parallels to GoDig Ladders
- Ladders = player-defined safety points (like pitons)
- Limited resource = meaningful placement decisions
- Creates 'commit' moments - where to spend resource

## Research Questions
1. How does Cairn balance piton scarcity vs frustration?
2. What visual feedback exists for good/bad piton spots?
3. How does fall distance affect penalty?
4. What makes placement feel like player skill, not luck?

## Expected Outputs
- Best practices for player-defined checkpoint systems
- Visual feedback recommendations for ladder placement
- Potential 'partial return' mechanic using ladder positions
