How does player recover if stuck? Questions: What counts as 'stuck'? (no ladders, can't dig up, surrounded) Can player reload last autosave from pause menu? Is there a 'rescue' teleport option? (costs coins or free?) How do we prevent soft-locks? Should there be a 'dig up' ability as last resort? What's the UX for choosing to reload?
