## Purpose

Investigate how mining games make falling and gravity feel satisfying and impactful. The sensation of dropping through mined blocks is a core game feel element.

## Questions to Research

1. How do games vary fall speed based on weight/upgrades?
2. What screen effects enhance falling sensation (blur, stretch)?
3. How does camera follow during falls create impact?
4. What landing effects make gravity feel weighty?
5. How do games balance realistic vs gamey fall physics?

## Sources to Check
- Getting Over It physics feel
- Celeste fall/landing game feel
- Spelunky momentum design
- Jump King weight feel
- Super Meat Boy physics design docs

## Output
Create Docs/research/gravity-weight-feel.md with physics feel recommendations.
