Study how games balance player agency with automation. Analyze: (1) Idle Miner Tycoon's manager system, (2) Melvor Idle's active/idle modes, (3) Factorio's pollution-driven difficulty, (4) Cookie Clicker's golden cookie mechanics. Focus on preventing automation from trivializing active gameplay, maintaining meaningful decisions, and preserving 'one more run' psychology. Output: Docs/research/automation-idle-balance.md
