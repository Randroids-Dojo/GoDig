## Purpose

Continuous monitoring of mining game releases, player feedback, and game design discussions to keep GoDig's design evolving and competitive.

## Research Areas

### Games to Monitor
- **Active Mining**: SteamWorld Dig series, Super Motherload, Terraria
- **Idle Mining**: Mr. Mine, Idle Miner Tycoon, Idle Mining Empire
- **Roguelite Mining**: Dome Keeper, Spelunky 2
- **New Releases**: itch.io indie mining games, Steam new releases

### Discussion Forums
- Reddit: r/gamedesign, r/indiegaming, r/roguelikes
- Steam discussions for competitor games
- BoardGameGeek for push-your-luck mechanics

### Design Principles to Track
- Core loop satisfaction
- Push-your-luck mechanics
- Mobile-specific UX patterns
- Monetization that doesn't frustrate

## Research Log

### Session 8 (2026-02-01)
**Mr. Mine Analysis**:
- Depth-based surprises key to engagement
- Fast satisfaction curve (minutes, not hours)
- Hybrid active/passive appeals to multiple playstyles
- Milestones tied to content unlocks, not just numbers

**Dome Keeper 2024-2025**:
- Hit 1M players - validates mining + defense loop
- Complaints: "too slow, repetitive, grindy"
- Mitigation: Quick-buy, elevator, procedural variety

### Topics for Future Research
- [ ] Analyze Spelunky 2's "secrets and lessons" retention
- [ ] Study Terraria's biome discovery system
- [ ] Review idle game monetization patterns
- [ ] Research haptic feedback patterns on iOS/Android
- [ ] Study one-hand mobile controls in similar games

## How to Use This Task

This is a **standing research task** - never closes. Each research session should:
1. Check for new games/updates in the space
2. Read recent player feedback on competitors
3. Search game design forums for relevant discussions
4. Document findings in `Docs/research/fun-factor-analysis.md`
5. Create `implement:` dots for actionable improvements

## Note

This research task supports the user directive to "research similar games and online forums around game design endlessly to keep making our design better and better."
