Analyze player expectations and pain points with cloud saves. Study: (1) Apple Arcade's seamless sync, (2) Genshin Impact's account linking friction, (3) Among Us cross-platform issues, (4) Minecraft Realms sync. Focus on: conflict resolution UI, trust-building for overwrite decisions, offline-first with eventual sync. Output: Docs/research/cloud-save-cross-platform.md
