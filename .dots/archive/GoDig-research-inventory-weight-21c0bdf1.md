close-reason: Completed research on inventory weight vs slot systems. Created Docs/research/inventory-weight-vs-slots.md covering trade-offs, mobile UI considerations, mining game examples (Dome Keeper, Motherload, SteamWorld Dig, Terraria), and GoDig-specific slot-based recommendation.

Compare weight-based vs slot-based inventory systems for mining games. Analyze: Motherload tank capacity, Terraria stack limits, SteamWorld Dig weight, Dome Keeper carrying capacity, Diablo inventory tetris. Questions: Does weight add meaningful decisions or just tedium? How does inventory system affect return trip tension? What UI works best on mobile for inventory management? How to balance capacity upgrades in progression? Reference: inventory tension implementation task.
