Research shows elevator should appear as REWARD/DISCOVERY when player reaches certain depth (200m), not just as item to purchase. Create celebration moment when elevator becomes available - popup, fanfare, 'You've discovered a way to fast-travel\!' This frames it as achievement rather than transaction. Affected files: scripts/autoload/game_manager.gd, UI celebration system. Verify: Reaching 200m triggers elevator discovery celebration, celebration explains what elevator does, player feels rewarded not just offered product.
