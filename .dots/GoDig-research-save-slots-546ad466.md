How does the save system work? Questions: How many save slots? (3 recommended) When does autosave trigger? (depth milestone, time interval, on surface?) What gets saved? (position, inventory, coins, world state, unlocks) How is chunk modification persisted? What's the save file format? How does 'Continue' vs 'New Game' work?
