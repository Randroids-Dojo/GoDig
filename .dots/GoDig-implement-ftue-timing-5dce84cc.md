Ensure first-time user experience hits key milestones: first ore discovered within 30 seconds, first sell completed within 60 seconds, first upgrade purchased within 3 minutes. 25% of users abandon after one session - good onboarding increases retention by 50%. Teach by doing, not telling. Reference Session 30 onboarding research.
