close-reason: Implemented DepthDiscoveryManager with 5 depth tiers of discoveries (caves, equipment, veins, relics, formations). Added UI notification system and save/load persistence. Integrated with chunk generation.

Based on Mr. Mine research (Session 26), each depth layer should introduce discoverable surprises - caves, abandoned equipment, rare ore veins. Not just harder blocks. Random events like finding a mysterious cave mix up routine gameplay and add excitement.
