## Purpose
Deep dive into Drill Core's identified pacing problems to avoid similar issues in GoDig.

## Background
From Session 31 research, Drill Core received criticism for:
- Runs lasting longer than other roguelikes
- Three separate meta-progression systems 'competing for attention'
- 'Gameplay gets repetitive quickly despite variations'
- Unit AI issues causing frustration

## Research Questions
1. What is the ideal run length for mining roguelites?
2. How many progression systems is too many?
3. What causes 'repetitive gameplay' feeling - mechanical or pacing?
4. How do successful games avoid mid-game fatigue?

## Investigation Areas
- Compare Drill Core run length vs SteamWorld Dig vs Dome Keeper
- Analyze 'three competing systems' problem - what systems and why they conflict
- Study player reviews specifically mentioning repetition
- Look for solutions implemented in post-launch patches

## Expected Outputs
- Run length recommendation for GoDig (target: 5-10 minutes)
- Single progression system validation (coins only)
- Variety injection points to prevent repetition
