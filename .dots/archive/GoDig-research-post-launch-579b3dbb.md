Investigate how successful mobile games (Clash Royale, Candy Crush, Brawl Stars) implement live ops: seasonal events, limited-time challenges, battle passes, themed content rotations. Focus on: event cadence, player psychology, FOMO-free design, reward structures, development cost vs engagement ROI. Reference implementation tasks: challenge-run modifier system (v1.1). Key questions: How often should events rotate? What makes an event feel special vs exhausting? How to balance exclusive rewards with FOMO concerns?
