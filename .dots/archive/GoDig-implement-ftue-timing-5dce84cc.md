title: "implement: FTUE timing - first ore 30s, sell 60s, upgrade 3min"
status: closed

close-reason: Added analytics tracking for first ore, first sell, and first upgrade timing. Existing systems (guaranteed ore, FTUE hints, celebration overlays) support the 30s/60s/3min targets.

Ensure first-time user experience hits key milestones: first ore discovered within 30 seconds, first sell completed within 60 seconds, first upgrade purchased within 3 minutes. 25% of users abandon after one session - good onboarding increases retention by 50%. Teach by doing, not telling. Reference Session 30 onboarding research.
