Research SciFi audio design patterns for mining games. Cover: procedural sound generation, synthesizer-based SFX, ambient soundscapes for alien environments, UI feedback sounds (holographic, digital), drill/mining sounds with futuristic feel, and depth-based audio progression. This supports the SciFi visual redesign plan's audio gap.
