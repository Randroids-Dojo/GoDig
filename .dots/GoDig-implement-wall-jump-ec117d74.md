Research (Session 19): Return journey shouldn't feel tedious - it should feel skillful. When player chains multiple wall-jumps efficiently, provide subtle feedback (speed trail, combo counter, satisfying sound). Makes climbing back feel like a skill being mastered, not just backtracking. Affected files: scripts/player/player.gd, UI for combo counter. Verify: Chaining 3+ wall-jumps shows visual feedback, combo counter appears briefly, player feels skilled not annoyed during return.
