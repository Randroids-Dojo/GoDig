Research how mining/digging games introduce enemies without disrupting the meditative core loop. Study: (1) Terraria's enemy spawn rates and safe zones, (2) SteamWorld Dig enemy placement philosophy, (3) Spelunky's 'fair' enemy design, (4) Dome Keeper's wave structure. Focus on: optional danger zones vs mandatory combat, enemy as environmental hazard vs active threat, preserving mining satisfaction. Output: Docs/research/enemy-design-peaceful-mining.md
