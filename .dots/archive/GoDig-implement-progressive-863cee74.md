Hide game systems not needed for first 15 minutes of gameplay. Start with just dig/collect/sell. Progressively introduce: shop (minute 3), inventory management (minute 5), upgrades (minute 7), deeper mechanics later. Warning from research: Heavy tutorials harm games. Reference Session 30 onboarding research.
