Research best practices for haptic feedback in mobile games. Topics: 1) iOS Haptic Engine patterns and intensities, 2) When haptics add value (discovery, impact) vs distract, 3) Player preference data on vibration, 4) Accessibility concerns and opt-out design, 5) Battery impact considerations. Output: Docs/research/mobile-haptics-deep.md for haptic implementation.
