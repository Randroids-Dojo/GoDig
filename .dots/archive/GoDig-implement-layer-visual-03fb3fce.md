close-reason: Added visual identity properties to LayerData (signature elements, atmospheric particles, fog, ambient sound, lore elements, signature ores). Updated all 10 layer .tres files with distinct identities inspired by Terraria biomes.

Each of 7 layers needs distinct visual identity like Terraria biomes: unique color palette, distinct background, specific ore types, environmental storytelling. Hallow uses pastels + crystals, Corruption uses purple + thorns. Our layers need equally strong signatures. Reference Session 30 Terraria biome research.
