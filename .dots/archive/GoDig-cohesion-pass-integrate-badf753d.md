STOP adding new features. Focus on blending existing systems into a cohesive, fun game loop.

Key areas to address:
- How do all the celebration systems (close-call, discovery, wall-jump mastery) feel together?
- Do the tension systems (inventory, depth, enemies) create interesting decisions?
- Is the risk/reward balance compelling across a full session?
- Does the progression feel natural (FTUE → early game → late game)?
- Are features discoverable without overwhelming the player?
- Cut or simplify features that don't serve the core loop

Goal: A player should feel pulled into 'one more run' - not confused by feature sprawl.
