Analyze and improve the 'micro-discovery' moments that drive engagement in mining games.

## Research Findings
- Variable ratio reinforcement: unpredictable rewards more engaging than predictable
- Each block should hold promise of discovery
- Rare finds create memorable 'jackpot' moments
- Visual/audio distinction for discoveries is critical

## Questions to Answer
1. What % of blocks contain something interesting vs just dirt?
2. Are ore distributions creating enough 'surprise' moments?
3. Do rare finds feel sufficiently celebrated?
4. Are caves/hidden areas generating discovery dopamine?

## Deliverables
- Current ore/discovery distribution analysis
- Implementation dots for improving reward variance
