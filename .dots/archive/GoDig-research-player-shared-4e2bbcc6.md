## Purpose

Investigate how roguelites enable players to share challenges, seeds, and custom runs with each other. Find patterns for community engagement without full modding support.

## Questions to Research

1. How do games implement shareable seeds (Slay the Spire, Spelunky)?
2. What daily/weekly challenge formats work for community engagement?
3. How do leaderboards with challenge modifiers function?
4. What social features support challenge sharing without full UGC?
5. How do mining games implement screenshot/replay sharing?

## Sources to Check
- Slay the Spire daily climb design
- Spelunky daily challenge format
- Dead Cells daily run system
- Nuclear Throne daily/weekly runs
- Balatro challenge sharing

## Output
Create Docs/research/player-shared-challenges.md with recommendations for GoDig social/challenge features.
