## Purpose

Investigate how players relate to their unique procedurally generated worlds. Understanding world attachment helps design save systems and sharing features.

## Questions to Research

1. How do players develop attachment to their specific world seed?
2. What makes worlds feel unique vs randomly shuffled?
3. How do games make procedural worlds feel authored?
4. What elements should be procedural vs hand-placed?
5. How do shared seeds create community engagement?

## Sources to Check
- Minecraft seed sharing culture
- No Man's Sky world uniqueness
- Dwarf Fortress world generation attachment
- Spelunky level generation papers
- RimWorld storyteller personality

## Output
Create Docs/research/procedural-world-attachment.md with world generation recommendations.
