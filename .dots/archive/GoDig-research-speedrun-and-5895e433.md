## Purpose

Investigate how speedrun and challenge communities form around mining/digging games and what design elements support player-created challenges.

## Questions to Research

1. What speedrun categories exist for games like SteamWorld Dig, Motherload, Spelunky?
2. What self-imposed challenges do communities create (no upgrades, pacifist, etc.)?
3. How do games support challenge runs without explicit modes?
4. What metrics/leaderboards encourage challenge play?
5. How do mining games handle RNG in speedruns (seeded runs)?

## Sources to Check
- Speedrun.com categories for mining games
- Reddit challenge run discussions
- YouTube challenge run content
- GDQ/speedrun community resources

## Output
Create Docs/research/speedrun-challenge-culture.md with findings and recommendations for GoDig challenge support.
