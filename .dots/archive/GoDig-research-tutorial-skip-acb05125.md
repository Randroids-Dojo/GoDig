close-reason: Completed research on tutorial skip patterns. Created Docs/research/tutorial-skip-patterns.md covering design philosophies (forced, minimal, contextual, assist mode), returning player support, skill detection, and GoDig-specific tutorial recommendations.

Analyze how games handle tutorial systems for both new and returning players. Games to study: Hades contextual tips, Celeste assist mode, Hollow Knight optional hints, Dark Souls minimal tutorial, Animal Crossing pacing. Questions: When is a skip button appropriate vs forced tutorial? How to detect player skill level automatically? How to handle returning players who forgot mechanics? What's the right balance of hand-holding vs discovery? Reference: FTUE implementation tasks.
