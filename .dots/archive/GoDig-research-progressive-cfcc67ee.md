## Purpose
Research how successful mobile games reveal advanced features gradually for GoDig-implement-progressive-863cee74.

## Background
Progressive disclosure means hiding advanced systems until players need them. But:
- How do you avoid players feeling lost?
- When should features unlock?
- How do you signal that more exists without overwhelming?

## Games to Study
- Clash Royale (unlocks at arena levels)
- Pokemon GO (level-gated features)
- Stardew Valley (seasonal unlocks)
- Any games praised for onboarding

## Research Questions
1. What triggers should unlock new features?
2. How prominent should 'new feature' notifications be?
3. Should players be able to discover hidden features early?
4. How do you balance simplicity vs. depth?
5. What causes players to feel 'the game has nothing left'?

## Expected Outputs
- Feature unlock timeline for GoDig
- Notification/announcement UX patterns
- Guidelines for what to show vs. hide at each stage
