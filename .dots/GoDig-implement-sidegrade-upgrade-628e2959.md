Design late-game upgrades as sidegrades (new options/abilities) rather than pure stat increases. Roguelite research shows pure stat progression leads to 'inverse difficulty curve' where game gets easier over time. Sidegrades expand player options without trivializing early content. Examples: new item types, alternate abilities, inventory layouts. Reference Session 29 roguelite progression analysis.
