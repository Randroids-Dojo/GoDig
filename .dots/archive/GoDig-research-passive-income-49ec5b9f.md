Analyze passive income mechanics in successful idle games. Focus on: Idle Miner Tycoon, Realm Grinder, Cookie Clicker, Melvor Idle, NGU Idle. Questions: What ratio of passive vs active income feels fair? How to prevent passive income from making active play feel pointless? When should passive income unlock (early vs late game)? How to communicate offline earnings without overwhelming players? How do mobile games handle background/notification earnings? Reference: implement-passive-income task.
