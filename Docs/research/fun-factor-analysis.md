# Fun Factor Analysis - Mining Game Core Loop

> Research compilation from game design analysis, forums, and similar games.
> Last updated: 2026-02-01

## Core Loop Summary

```
1. DIG DOWN   -> Mine resources, discover ores (dopamine hits)
2. COLLECT    -> Fill inventory (accumulation satisfaction)
3. TENSION    -> Risk of getting stuck, distance from safety
4. RETURN     -> Navigate back to surface (challenge/relief)
5. SELL       -> Exchange resources (reward realization)
6. UPGRADE    -> Buy better tools (power fantasy)
7. REPEAT     -> Go deeper for rarer resources
```

## What Makes Mining Games Fun (Research Findings)

### 1. The Discovery Loop
- **Variable Ratio Reinforcement**: Unpredictable rewards are more engaging than predictable ones
- Each block broken reveals what's underneath - constant micro-discoveries
- "What's behind this block?" creates anticipation
- Rare finds create memorable "jackpot" moments

**Implementation Priority**: Ore distribution should create surprise, not predictable patterns.

### 2. Risk vs Reward Tension
- Deeper = more danger but better rewards
- Players should choose their risk tolerance
- The fear of losing collected resources drives strategic thinking
- Getting "stuck" should feel like a challenge, not a failure

**Key Insight from SteamWorld Dig**: Wall-jumping transformed "stuck" from binary failure to recoverable predicaments. Players who fell into holes initially panicked, then discovered clever escape routes - creating satisfaction through problem-solving.

### 3. Investment Protection
- "I've collected so much, must get back safely"
- Creates natural tension and stakes
- Makes safe return feel like victory
- Full inventory = immediate goal to return

**Design Implication**: Inventory size directly controls session pacing.

### 4. Upgrade Satisfaction
- Slow pickaxe -> fast pickaxe should be FELT
- Visual upgrade differences matter
- Speed improvements are immediately noticeable
- Power fantasy fulfillment

**Dome Keeper Finding**: "This immediately provides visible feedback in the form of faster digging, and passive feedback in that future upgrades come sooner. This kind of tangible feedback feels great."

### 5. Home Base Comfort
- Surface represents safety
- Shops provide upgrade satisfaction
- Contrast makes surface feel rewarding
- Cycle between danger and comfort creates satisfying rhythm

### 6. Session Design
- Target: 5-15 minute sessions with natural stopping points
- Inventory full is most natural break point
- Should happen every 3-8 minutes early game
- "Just fill inventory then stop" mindset

## Critical Early Game Requirements

1. **First upgrade in 2-5 minutes** - Critical retention moment
2. **Starting ladders available** - Teaches mechanic safely
3. **Supply Store at 0m** - Players need escape items before getting stuck
4. **Clear feedback loops** - Every action has visible reaction

## Juice/Game Feel Priorities

| Element | Priority | Impact |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Ore discovery sound/visual | High | Core dopamine trigger |
| Upgrade celebration | High | Milestone moment |
| Screen shake on hard blocks | Medium | Satisfying feedback |
| Combo/streak sounds | Medium | Rhythm building |
| Inventory warnings | High | Creates return tension |
| Depth milestones | Medium | Progress celebration |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Getting truly stuck with no escape** - Always provide recovery options
2. **Dead zones without meaningful upgrades** - Something new every 10-15 min
3. **Loss that erases too much progress** - Death should sting, not devastate
4. **Artificial waiting/timers** - Respect player time
5. **Tedious return trips** - Elevator unlocks help late game
