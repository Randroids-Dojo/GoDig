## Purpose

Research how games guide player attention in complex interfaces without overwhelming them, especially on mobile where screen real estate is limited.

## Research Questions

1. How do successful mobile games prioritize UI elements?
2. What visual techniques draw attention to important information?
3. How do games balance information density with clarity?
4. What's the role of animation in UI attention guidance?
5. How do games handle multiple notification types simultaneously?

## Games to Study
- Dead Cells (status effect clarity)
- Slay the Spire (card game UI)
- Marvel Snap (mobile card game)
- Loop Hero (minimal HUD)
- Vampire Survivors (chaos management)

## GoDig Application
- HUD element prioritization
- Achievement/notification stacking
- Inventory tension communication
- Depth/resource balance display
- Low-ladder warning visibility
