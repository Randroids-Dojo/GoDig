## Question
What creates ideal 5-15 minute sessions with natural stopping points?

## Current Stopping Points
1. Inventory full - must return to sell
2. Out of ladders - must return to buy
3. Death - respawn at surface

## Potential Issues
- Sessions too long = mobile unfriendly
- Sessions too short = no progression feeling
- Forced stops = frustrating
- No stops = endless grind

## Research Tasks
- [ ] Analyze: what triggers players to stop playing similar games?
- [ ] Calculate: average time to fill 8 slots with ore
- [ ] Check: do other mobile games have session length data?
- [ ] Consider: should we add soft 'time to go back' reminders?

## Expected Outcome
Concrete design recommendations for session pacing
