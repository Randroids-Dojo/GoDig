## Purpose

Research how games use dynamic audio to enhance exploration and depth-based progression without repetition fatigue.

## Research Questions

1. How do games layer audio based on game state?
2. What makes procedural music feel cohesive vs random?
3. How do games handle audio transitions between areas?
4. What's the role of silence vs constant music?
5. How do ambient sounds communicate game information?

## Games to Study
- Minecraft (biome audio)
- Subnautica (depth-based audio)
- No Man's Sky (procedural music)
- Hollow Knight (area themes)
- Dead Cells (adaptive intensity)

## GoDig Application
- Depth-based audio layers
- Surface vs underground contrast
- Danger warning sounds
- Mining satisfaction sounds
- Shop ambiance

## Deliverable
