Deep dive into how successful roguelites combine handcrafted content with procedural arrangement. Specific areas to research: 1) Spelunky's room template system and connection rules, 2) Hades' encounter design and room flow, 3) Dead Cells' level generation patterns, 4) How to ensure 'playable' guarantees in procedural systems, 5) Entry/exit point design for seamless chunk connection. Output: Docs/research/handcrafted-procedural-design.md with actionable patterns for GoDig.
