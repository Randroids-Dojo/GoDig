Research how games communicate danger without frustrating players. Topics: 1) Dark Souls enemy tells and attack windups, 2) How to telegraph environmental hazards, 3) Health warning systems (screen tint, heartbeat sounds), 4) The difference between 'gotcha' deaths and fair challenges, 5) Difficulty communication without numbers. Output: Docs/research/fair-risk-communication.md for no-sudden-death implementation.
