# D1/D7/D30 Retention Patterns in Mobile Roguelites

> Research on player retention patterns and what drives return behavior.
> Last updated: 2026-02-02 (Session 26)

## Executive Summary

Retention is the single most important metric for mobile game success. The industry average is brutal: **73% of players leave after Day 1**. For roguelites, meta-progression and session design are the key levers. The first 10 minutes determine everything.

## 1. Retention Benchmarks (2024-2025)

### Industry Averages (All Mobile Games)

| Metric | Average | Top 25% | Top Performers |
|--------|---------|---------|----------------|
| D1 | 26-28% | 28-33% | 45%+ |
| D7 | 8% | 7-8% | 20%+ |
| D30 | <3% | 3-4% | 10%+ |

### Top Revenue Games (90th Percentile)
- D1: 35.4%
- D7: 14.3%
- D30: 6.1%

### Platform Differences
- iOS shows higher retention than Android
- Android has more sessions per day (6-7 for midcore)
- iOS users have longer sessions

### Genre-Specific Patterns
- **Arcade games**: Strong D1, weak D7/D30 (novelty wears off)
- **Board/Card/Casino**: Best long-term retention (habit formation)
- **Roguelites**: No specific benchmark data, likely between arcade and puzzle

## 2. Session Metrics (2024)

### Session Length
| Percentile | Session Length |
|------------|----------------|
| Top 25% | 8-9 minutes |
| Median | 5-6 minutes |
| Global Average | 4:45 |

**Gaming apps overall**: 31 minutes average (highest of all app categories)

### Session Frequency
- Average: 4 sessions/day
- Midcore games: 6-7 sessions/day
- Regional variation: Africa 5.45/day, North America 3.67/day

### Daily Playtime
- Median: 22 minutes/day
- Top 2%: Up to 4 hours/day

**GoDig Target**: 3-4 sessions of 5-8 minutes each = 20-30 minutes daily playtime

## 3. What Drives Day 1 Return

### The First 10 Minutes Are Critical

> "The worst performers lose 46% of new installs by the fifth minute. By the 10th minute, they've lost 58%."

**Key Insight**: The longer players stay on Day 0, the more likely they return on Day 1.

### Psychological Triggers for D1 Return

1. **Quick Victory**
   - Early accomplishment activates reward systems
   - First level complete, first enemy defeated, first resource collected
   - Creates "I can do this" feeling

2. **Visible Progress**
   - Show milestones and features ahead
   - Create anticipation for what's coming
   - Leave something unfinished (Zeigarnik effect)

3. **Dopamine from Learning**
   - New mechanics boost arousal during learning
   - Tutorials that feel like play, not instruction
   - "Aha!" moments create memory anchors

### Why Players DON'T Return (D1 Failures)

1. **Poor onboarding** - Player feels lost
2. **No "fun" visible** - Core loop unclear
3. **No emotional connection** - Nothing memorable happened
4. **Too hard/too easy** - Skill mismatch frustration

**GoDig D1 Requirements**:
- First ore discovery within 30 seconds
- First sell within 60 seconds
- First upgrade within 3 minutes
- Clear path to "next thing"

---

## 4. What Drives Day 7 Return

### Return Triggers

Return triggers are explicit gameplay advantages attached to future events:

1. **Appointment Mechanics**
   - Daily rewards that build over time
   - Day 7 = rare prize (Hills of Steel pattern)
   - Streaks without harsh punishment for breaking

2. **Unfinished Business**
   - "I was so close to that upgrade"
   - "I need 50 more coins for the pickaxe"
   - Clear, achievable goals left pending

3. **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**
   - Limited-time events
   - Special characters/items
   - Weekend-only content

4. **Social Connection**
   - Leaderboards
   - Friend activity
   - Community events

### Meta-Progression for Roguelites

> "The best roguelite games combine high-stakes gameplay and long-term progress."

Successful patterns:
- **Permanent upgrades** that survive death
- **Gradual unlocks** that teach new mechanics
- **Ascension systems** for increased challenge
- **Meaningful choices** that don't have one optimal path

**Warning**: Heavy meta-progression can hurt mastery feel. Balance is key.

## 5. What Drives Day 30 Return

### Long-Term Retention Factors

1. **Habit Formation**
   - Consistent daily engagement creates routine
   - Same time of day triggers (commute, bedtime)
   - Low-friction session start

2. **Depth Revealed Over Time**
   - Systems that take time to master
   - Content unlocked through play
   - Always something new to discover

3. **Identity Investment**
   - Player sees self as "a GoDig player"
   - Community participation
   - Progress worth protecting

4. **Varied Experience**
   - No two sessions identical
   - New challenges emerge
   - Meta shifts with updates

### Roguelite-Specific D30 Patterns

From successful mobile roguelites (Shattered Pixel Dungeon, Slice & Dice):
- **No predatory monetization** builds trust and loyalty
- **Complete absence of FOMO mechanics** reduces burnout
- **Strategic depth** rewards returning players
- **Community-driven development** creates investment

## 6. Notification Best Practices

### The Challenge
Gaming has the **lowest push notification opt-in rate** of any industry: 63.5%

### What Works

1. **Personalization**
   - Use player's in-game name
   - Reference their progress
   - 259% higher engagement than generic

2. **Timing**
   - Best times: 12pm-1pm, 7pm-9pm local time
   - Weekdays outperform weekends (77% sent Mon-Fri)
   - ALWAYS use player's local timezone

3. **Value-First Content**
   - Daily rewards ready to claim
   - Progress milestones achieved
   - New content available
   - NOT: "Come back and play!"

4. **Brevity**
   - Android: 60-90 characters ideal
   - iOS: Max 120 characters
   - Emojis increase open rates up to 85%

### What Doesn't Work

1. **Too frequent** - Users opt out or uninstall
2. **Irrelevant** - Generic "We miss you!" messages
3. **Bad timing** - Middle of night, during work
4. **Promotional** - "50% off gem pack!" annoys players

### iOS Permission Strategy

You only get ONE chance to ask for permission.
- Build trust first through gameplay
- Ask after a positive moment (achievement, reward)
- Explain what notifications will contain
- Consider a pre-permission primer screen

## 7. GoDig Retention Strategy

### D1 Targets
- **Target**: 40%+ (above industry average)
- **How**: First 5 minutes must deliver:
  - Discovery (ore found)
  - Accomplishment (sold for coins)
  - Anticipation (see upgrade path)
  - Unfinished goal (almost have enough for X)

### D7 Targets
- **Target**: 15%+ (above industry average)
- **How**:
  - Meta-progression visible from D1
  - Upgrade unlocked by D2-D3
  - Daily reward system (non-punishing)
  - "Just one more run" loop established

### D30 Targets
- **Target**: 8%+ (above industry average)
- **How**:
  - Deep progression revealed over time
  - New layers unlocked (depths, features)
  - No monetization pressure
  - Community features (v1.1)

### Session Design for Retention

| Session | Duration | Goal |
|---------|----------|------|
| 1 | 5-8 min | Complete first loop (dig-sell-upgrade) |
| 2-5 | 5-8 min | Establish rhythm, unlock features |
| Daily | 3-4 sessions | Natural stopping points (full inventory) |

### Anti-Churn Measures

1. **Instant resume** - Pick up exactly where left off
2. **No punishing deaths** - Resources preserved on death
3. **Clear goals** - Always know what to work toward
4. **Visible progress** - Can't feel stuck

## 8. Retention Impact on Revenue

> "Increasing retention rates by just 5% can increase profits by up to 95%."

### Why Retention > Acquisition
- Retained users spend more over time
- Organic word-of-mouth from engaged players
- Lower cost to retain than acquire
- LTV (lifetime value) compounds with retention
