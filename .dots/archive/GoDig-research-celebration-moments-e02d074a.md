Research how mobile games celebrate achievements without overwhelming. Topics: 1) Clash Royale chest opening and milestone celebrations, 2) When confetti/particles enhance vs distract, 3) Audio celebration design (fanfares, chimes), 4) Duration of celebration animations, 5) How celebration frequency affects perceived value. Output: Docs/research/celebration-design.md for safe return and wall-jump celebrations.
