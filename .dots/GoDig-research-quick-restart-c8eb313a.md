Research how successful roguelikes minimize the time between death/completion and starting a new run. Key insight from research: 'Near-instant restart after failure - Menus getting in the way antagonizes frustrated players.' Investigate: Dead Cells, Spelunky 2, Hades restart flows. Document patterns for GoDig (death, forfeit cargo, after-sell).
