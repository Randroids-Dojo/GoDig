close-reason: Created UIColors class with unified 3-color palette (Gold, Green, Blue). Updated hud.gd and number_animator.gd to reference centralized colors instead of hardcoded values. Version bumped to 0.14.0.

Create consistent color language: HP bar green, progress bars, buttons all using 2-3 cohesive colors instead of mixed teal/gray/green
