## Purpose

Research how games maintain engagement after players have mastered core mechanics and seen most content.

## Research Questions

1. What keeps players engaged after 'beating' a roguelite?
2. How do incremental games maintain engagement in late-game?
3. What's the role of cosmetics vs gameplay in endgame?
4. How do prestige/rebirth systems sustain interest?
5. What causes players to finally quit vs continue indefinitely?

## Games to Study
- Hades (relationship progression)
- Cookie Clicker (ascension depth)
- Binding of Isaac (unlock trees)
- Risk of Rain 2 (artifact system)
- Enter the Gungeon (completion percentage)

## GoDig Application
- When to introduce prestige
- Collection/achievement depth
- Sidegrade variety timing
- Challenge mode design
- Community features for longevity

## Deliverable
