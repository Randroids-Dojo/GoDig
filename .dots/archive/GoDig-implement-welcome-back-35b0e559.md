close-reason: "Implemented guilt-free welcome-back rewards: WelcomeBackManager tracks absence without streaks, shows progress reminders (depth record, blocks mined), and gifts 2-10 free ladders based on time away. WelcomeBackPopup displays warm celebration. Integrated with SaveManager. No streak punishment mechanics."

Based on lapsed player re-engagement research (Session 26), welcome-back rewards should feel like a gift, not guilt. Mistplay found players were happier without streak pressure. Show depth record + progress reminder + free ladders. Avoid daily login calendars that punish absence.
