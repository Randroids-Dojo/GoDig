## Description

Study how mining games maintain challenge after players master the core mechanics. Hades 2 added tougher foes in completed areas; how should GoDig handle this?

## Key Questions
- How do we prevent early areas from becoming trivially easy?
- Should enemies spawn in cleared areas? Or just harder blocks?
- What mechanics prevent the 'solved game' feeling?

## Research Sources
- Hades 2 1.0 difficulty changes
- SteamWorld Dig 2 endgame design
- Roguelike mastery design patterns
