Research how audio creates tension and depth perception. Topics: 1) Deep Rock Galactic cave ambience, 2) Subnautica depth pressure audio, 3) Horror game tension layers (low drones, heartbeat), 4) When music vs silence creates more tension, 5) Audio cues for safety/danger zones. Output: Docs/research/tension-audio-design.md for subtle tension audio implementation.
