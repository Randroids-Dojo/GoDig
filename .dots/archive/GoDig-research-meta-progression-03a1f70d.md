Analyze successful prestige implementations that feel rewarding not punishing. Study: (1) Realm Grinder's reincarnation depth, (2) Adventure Capitalist's angel investors, (3) Archero's talent system across resets, (4) Hades' permanent upgrades. Focus on: when to introduce prestige, what persists vs resets, creating 'earned shortcut' psychology. Output: Docs/research/meta-progression-prestige.md
