close-reason: "Added haptic feedback calls to shop upgrades: tool, backpack, warehouse, passive income, equipment purchases. Also added haptic on sell and gadget purchase. Already had disable option via settings."

Based on haptic feedback research (Session 28), add subtle haptic on ore discovery and stronger feedback on upgrade purchase. iOS offers more nuanced control than Android. Haptics must match visual/audio feedback. Accessibility: always provide disable option as some users find vibrations overwhelming.
