## Purpose

Investigate how exploration/mining games teach mechanics without removing the joy of discovery. GoDig needs progressive disclosure that preserves surprise.

## Questions to Research

1. How does Hollow Knight teach without explicit tutorials?
2. What Metroidvania tutorials respect player intelligence?
3. How do games hint at mechanics without explaining them?
4. What failure-as-learning approaches work in mining games?
5. How do games balance accessibility with discovery preservation?

## Sources to Check
- Breath of the Wild Great Plateau design
- Hollow Knight opening tutorial analysis
- Spelunky 2 tutorial cave design
- Dark Souls implicit tutorial
- Tunic language-barrier teaching

## Output
Create Docs/research/tutorial-discovery-balance.md with tutorial design recommendations.
