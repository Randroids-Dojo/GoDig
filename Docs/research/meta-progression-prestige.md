# Meta-Progression and Prestige Systems in Mobile Roguelites

> Research on making resets feel rewarding rather than punishing

## Executive Summary

Prestige systems transform what could feel like "losing progress" into "unlocking power." This research analyzes how successful games implement meta-progression to create the "one more run" motivation while respecting player time investment.

**Key Finding**: The best prestige systems create **earned shortcuts** - players restart faster and more powerfully, making future runs more efficient. The feeling should be "I'm building toward something," not "I'm losing everything."

## Deep Dive: Realm Grinder Multi-Layer Prestige

### The Depth of Prestige

Realm Grinder exemplifies layered prestige:

> "Most idle games have one reset mechanism; Realm Grinder offers two or three different levels."

**Layer 1: Abdication**
- Collect gems (standard prestige currency)
- Percentage bonuses on production

**Layer 2: Reincarnation**
- Requires 1 octillion (1Oc) gems
- Unlocks new factions, abilities
- Resets gold AND gems

### Why Multi-Layer Works

> "Each abdication works like standard reset, but reincarnations are where the fireworks happen. Every reset feels like a leap forward, not a setback."

Benefits:
1. Short-term goals (abdication)
2. Long-term goals (reincarnation)
3. New content unlocks at each layer
4. Players always have something to work toward

### Progression Unlocks

Content gates create anticipation:
- R0: Base 6 factions
- R3: Treaty factions (Dwarves/Drow)
- R100: New production formulas
- R125: Triple faction play

### Criticism to Address

> "Without the Reincarnation mechanic, you'd breeze through the game very fast."

Some players feel prestige artificially extends content. **Solution**: Ensure each prestige layer adds *new* experiences, not just bigger numbers.

## Deep Dive: Adventure Capitalist Angel Investors

### The Psychological Hook

> "Angel Investors are received only by completely resetting your game. You get them based on total earnings - the more you earned, the more angels."

This creates the "sacrifice for growth" dynamic:
- Give up everything visible
- Gain permanent multipliers
- Return stronger than before

### Reset Timing Psychology

> "Generally you want to wait until you at least double the number of angels from your current total."

The doubling rule creates:
- Clear decision threshold
- Anticipation building
- Satisfaction when threshold met

### The 2-3 Hour Investment

> "A typical reset can take 2-3 hours to put back to what it used to be."

Important insight: **Time to recover** affects reset psychology:
- Too fast: Resets feel meaningless
- Too slow: Resets feel punishing
- Sweet spot: Noticeable but bearable

### Multi-World Isolation

Each planet has separate prestige:
> "Consider the three planets as separate individual games."

This prevents overwhelming complexity while allowing parallel progression.

## Deep Dive: Archero Talent System

### Permanent, Linear Progression

Unlike reset-based prestige, Archero talents are **purely additive**:

> "Once you unlock a Talent, you will receive that buff forever. Each time you enter a game these buffs will be enabled."

### Design Strengths

1. **No Loss Psychology**: Players never lose talents
2. **Clear Path**: 22 upgrades in fixed order
3. **Random Elements**: Which talent next adds surprise
4. **Gold Sink**: Prevents currency inflation

### Key Talents

| Talent | Effect | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Glory** | Start with 1 ability | Game-changing for early run |
| **Agile** | +2% attack speed | Core stat improvement |
| **Inspire** | Heal on level up | Survivability |
| **Time Reward** | Offline progress | Idle integration |

### Hero-Agnostic Design

> "Talents persist across every Archero hero and run."

This creates:
- Investment confidence (won't be wasted)
- Hero experimentation (talents work on all)
- Long-term planning

## Deep Dive: Hades Mirror of Night

### The Gold Standard

Hades' Mirror is widely praised for its implementation:

> "It's a fantastic system - one of the best in gaming - because it's so customisable."

### Key Design Elements

**1. Linear Introduction**
> "Hades presents a linear selection of upgrades - go down the Mirror and buy them when you can. It doesn't overwhelm you with options straight away."

**2. Gated Unlocks**
> "Future upgrades are locked behind keys that you collect during each run. Players don't shoot themselves in the foot saving for endgame upgrades."

**3. Free Respec**
> "You can reset it for just a few keys, and it refunds all your Darkness so you can respec however you want."

**4. Dual-Track Options**
Each ability has two versions (red/green), adding depth without complexity.

### Never Wasted Runs

> "One of the developer's design philosophies is that you should never feel like you just wasted your whole run for nothing."

Even failed runs yield:
- Darkness (upgrade currency)
- Keys (unlock new upgrades)
- Story progression
- Relationship building

### The Death Defiance Philosophy

Best upgrade: Death Defiance (extra lives)

> "Basically gives you another life so that even if your HP drops to zero, you'll be resurrected at half-health."

This reduces frustration while maintaining challenge - you still have to earn the defiances.

## Prestige Timing: When to Introduce

### Too Early Risks

- Players don't understand base game
- Reset feels arbitrary
- No emotional investment to sacrifice

### Too Late Risks

- Players hit walls without recourse
- Frustration before unlock
- May quit before seeing the system

### Research Recommendation

> "You can combine quick early game meta progression with roguelike games as a tutorial mechanic, given that it's relatively quickly unlocked."

**GoDig Timing Suggestion**:
- Basic talents: From run 1 (Archero model)
- First prestige option: After first 1000m depth
- Full prestige system: v1.1+ feature

### Gradual Tutorial Integration

> "Slay the Spire uses meta progression through Ascension - you start with a bit easier mode until you can handle it."

Structure unlocks as teaching tools:
1. Run 1-5: Core mechanics
2. Run 6-10: Basic upgrades
3. Run 11+: Full system access

## Psychology: What Persists vs. Resets

### Must Persist (Players Expect)

| Element | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Cosmetics** | Identity investment |
| **Achievements** | Accomplishment record |
| **Story progress** | Narrative investment |
| **Skill knowledge** | Player growth |

### Can Reset (Acceptable)

| Element | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Currency** | Easy to re-earn |
| **Upgrades** | Prestige multipliers compensate |
| **Depth progress** | Core loop refreshes |

### Should Never Reset

| Element | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Time-gated unlocks** | Feels like stolen time |
| **Paid content** | Trust violation |
| **Difficulty settings** | Accessibility |

## Design Recommendations for GoDig

### Core Principles

1. **Never Wasted**: Every run yields meaningful progress
2. **Earned Shortcuts**: Prestige makes future runs faster
3. **Optional Power**: Players choose when to reset
4. **New Content**: Prestige unlocks new features/areas
5. **Clear Thresholds**: Obvious when to prestige

### Suggested System Architecture

**Layer 1: Permanent Talents (Always Active)**
- Like Archero: spend XP on permanent stat boosts
- Linear unlock order
- No reset ever

**Layer 2: Depth Mastery (Prestige Currency)**
- Earn "Mastery Points" based on max depth
- Prestige: Reset depth, keep Mastery Points
- Spend on permanent multipliers

**Layer 3: Prestige Tiers (v1.1+)**
- After reaching 1000m multiple times
- Unlock new layers, ores, mechanics
- Major progression gate

### Prestige Currency Design

**Mastery Points** calculation:
```
Points = (Max Depth / 100) * (Total Ores Sold / 1000) * Prestige Multiplier
```

This rewards:
- Deep exploration
- Efficient selling
- Accumulated prestige

### What Resets on Prestige

| Element | Resets | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Current depth | Yes | Core loop refresh |
| Coins | Partially | Keep some % |
| Pickaxe tier | No | Too painful |
| Inventory | Yes | Fresh start |
| Buildings | No | Investment protection |
| Ladders placed | Yes | World refreshes |
| Talents | Never | Permanent progress |

### What Unlocks with Prestige

| Prestige Level | Unlock |
|----------------|--------|
| **P1** | Mastery Point spending |
| **P2** | New ore types |
| **P3** | Deeper starting depth option |
| **P5** | New layer biome |
| **P10** | Automation building |

### Timing Recommendation

- **v1.0**: Permanent talents only (simple, always-forward)
- **v1.1**: Introduce prestige as "Rebirth"
- **v1.2**: Multi-tier prestige with new content

### UI Communication

Prestige should clearly show:
1. What you'll gain (multipliers, unlocks)
2. What you'll lose (current run progress)
3. What you'll keep (talents, achievements)
4. Comparison: current vs. post-prestige efficiency
