Research how mining/digging games handle enemies and combat. Games to analyze: SteamWorld Dig 2 enemy patterns, Terraria enemy progression, Dome Keeper alien waves, Spelunky threat design, Noita enemy behaviors. Key questions: Should enemies be avoidable or mandatory combat? How do enemies enhance vs interrupt mining flow? What role does enemy variety play at different depths? How to balance tension without frustrating the core digging loop? Reference: complete-enemy-system implementation task.
