## Purpose
Research daily reward systems that encourage return without psychological manipulation.

## Background
From Session 26 research (Mistplay):
- 'Players were happier without having the pressure' of streak systems
- Streak bonuses create guilt, not joy
- Welcome-back rewards should feel like gift, not guilt

## Research Questions
1. What alternatives to streak systems exist?
2. How do ethical games handle missed days?
3. What 'welcome back' patterns increase retention without FOMO?
4. How do games respect player time while encouraging return?

## Games/Patterns to Study
- Mistplay - removed streak pressure successfully
- Pokémon GO - comeback events
- State of Survival - Survivor Recall
- Any games praised for non-manipulative dailies

## Expected Outputs
- Design recommendations for GoDig welcome-back system
- Anti-FOMO patterns for daily rewards
- Ethical engagement principles for mobile
