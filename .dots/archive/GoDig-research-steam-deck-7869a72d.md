## Purpose

Investigate design considerations for Steam Deck and handheld gaming platforms. GoDig is mobile-first but may expand to Steam Deck.

## Questions to Research

1. What control schemes work well on Steam Deck for touch-designed games?
2. How do games handle portrait-to-landscape transitions?
3. What battery/performance considerations matter for handhelds?
4. How do games adapt mobile UI for larger handheld screens?
5. What are successful mobile-to-Steam Deck ports?

## Sources to Check
- Steam Deck verified game requirements
- Vampire Survivors Steam Deck success story
- Mobile games that launched on Steam
- Deckbuilder genre Steam Deck adaptations
- Control scheme comparison studies

## Output
Create Docs/research/steam-deck-handheld.md with platform considerations.
