Research how games create distinct area identities through visual design. Topics: 1) Hollow Knight biome color palettes and transitions, 2) Ori's environmental storytelling through color, 3) Dead Cells' area visual language, 4) Color psychology (warm=safe, cold=danger), 5) How palette shifts affect player navigation. Output: Docs/research/layer-visual-identity.md for depth palette implementation.
