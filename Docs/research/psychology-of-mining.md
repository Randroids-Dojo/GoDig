# Psychology of Mining Games

## Why Mining Games Are Addictive

### 1. The Discovery Loop

#### Exploration Dopamine
- Each block broken reveals what's underneath
- Constant micro-discoveries keep dopamine flowing
- "What's behind this block?" creates anticipation
- Unknown territory is inherently compelling

#### Variable Ratio Reinforcement
- Not every block contains treasure (like slot machines)
- Unpredictable rewards are more addictive than predictable
- "The next block might be gold" keeps players digging
- Rare finds create memorable "jackpot" moments

#### The Reveal Mechanic
- Mining literally "reveals" hidden content
- Players feel like explorers/archaeologists
- Creating your own path is empowering
- Permanent world changes give ownership

### 2. Collection Psychology

#### Completionism Drive
- "Gotta catch 'em all" mentality
- Resource tier lists encourage collection
- Museum/collection features tap into this
- Progress bars and checklists provide goals

#### Number Go Up
- Coin counter always increasing
- Depth meter tracking progress
- Statistics screens showing achievements
- Satisfying growth over time

#### Organized Hoarding
- Inventory organization is satisfying
- Sorting resources by type/value
- "Full chest" achievement feeling
- Physical representation of progress

### 3. Vertical Progress

#### Depth as Achievement
- Going deeper = tangible progress
- "How deep can I go?" is primal question
- Milestone celebrations reinforce progress
- Easy-to-understand progression metric

#### Layer Transitions as Goals
- Each new layer is a mini-achievement
- Visual change confirms progress
- New resources unlock at depth thresholds
- Creates natural "just one more layer" feeling

#### Risk/Reward Gradient
- Deeper = more danger but better rewards
- Players choose their risk tolerance
- Pushing limits feels exciting
- Safe returns feel relieving

### 4. The Return Trip

#### Investment Protection
- "I've collected so much, must get back safely"
- Creates natural tension and stakes
- Makes safe return feel like victory
- Inventory full = immediate goal to return

#### Sunk Cost Fallacy (Positive Use)
- "I've dug this far, can't stop now"
- Previous investment motivates continuation
- Each dig builds on previous work
- Creates commitment to the world

#### Home Base Comfort
- Surface represents safety
- Shops provide upgrade satisfaction
- Contrast makes surface feel rewarding
- Cycle between danger and comfort

### 5. Upgrade Satisfaction

#### Before/After Comparison
- Slow pickaxe → fast pickaxe is FELT
- Visual upgrade differences matter
- Speed improvements are immediately noticeable
- Power fantasy fulfillment

#### Earned Power
- Upgrades feel deserved (you worked for them)
- Previous difficulty makes current ease satisfying
- "I remember when this was hard"
- Competence growth over time

#### Choice and Agency
- Deciding what to upgrade creates investment
- Multiple upgrade paths allow personalization
- Trade-offs create meaningful decisions
- Player's mine reflects their choices

### 6. Spatial Ownership

#### World Modification
- Player literally reshapes the world
- Every tunnel is YOUR tunnel
- Creates unique, personal geography
- Looking back at your path is satisfying

#### Territory Claiming
- "This is MY mine"
- Named areas and landmarks
- Remembering where resources were found
- Building mental map creates attachment

#### Permanent Impact
- Changes persist across sessions
- World remembers your actions
- Investment grows over time
- Harder to quit when invested

## Design Implications for GoDig

### Maximize Discovery Moments
- Vary resource distribution (clusters, veins)
- Hidden caves create surprise discovery
- Rare finds should be visually distinct
- Sound design emphasizes discoveries

### Create Clear Progress
- Depth counter always visible
- Milestone celebrations are big events
- Layer transitions are memorable
- Statistics track everything

### Balance Risk/Reward
- Deeper = better rewards (must be worth it)
- Death/loss shouldn't erase too much progress
- Escape options reduce frustration
- Inventory full is natural "checkpoint"

### Make Upgrades Feel Good
- Visual changes for upgraded tools
- Speed/power differences should be noticeable
- Show before/after numbers
- Celebrate purchase with fanfare

### Build Attachment
- Save system preserves investment
- Never wipe player progress accidentally
- Make surface feel like "home"
- Name features after player discoveries?

## Psychological Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Frustration Points
- Getting stuck with no escape → solution required
- Losing too much progress on death → checkpoints
- Resource scarcity that feels unfair → balance carefully
- Difficulty walls → smooth progression curve

### Negative Addiction Patterns
- FOMO mechanics (time-limited without reason)
- Pay-to-skip frustration
- Artificial waiting (timers for no reason)
- Social pressure to spend

### Burnout Prevention
- Clear stopping points (inventory full, reached surface)
- Session length feedback
- Auto-save at good moments
- Don't punish breaks from game

## Retention Hooks

### Short-term (This Session)
- "One more layer"
- "Fill inventory then return"
- "Save up for upgrade"

### Medium-term (Today)
- Daily login rewards?
- "Reach depth milestone"
- "Unlock new shop"

### Long-term (This Week/Month)
- Prestige unlocks
- Achievement completion
- Collection goals
- Depth records

## Questions to Resolve
- [x] Death penalty → Lose 10% coins, keep inventory (merciful)
- [x] Wait timers → No artificial timers, respect player time
- [x] Collection categories → 3 (ores, gems, artifacts)
- [x] Prestige reset → Soft reset, keep permanent bonuses
