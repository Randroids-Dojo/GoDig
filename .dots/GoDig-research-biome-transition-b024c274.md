## Purpose
Study how metroidvanias handle visual/mechanical transitions between distinct areas.

## Background
From research, distinct layer identity is important:
- Each layer needs unique color palette, background, ore types
- But abrupt transitions can feel jarring
- Transition zones can create interesting gameplay moments

## Games to Analyze
1. **Hollow Knight** - Distinct biomes with subtle blending
2. **Ori series** - Beautiful biome transitions
3. **Dead Cells** - Biome variety, path choice
4. **Terraria** - Surface/Underground/Cavern transitions

## Research Questions
1. How do these games signal upcoming biome changes?
2. What visual elements blend between zones?
3. Do mechanics change at transitions or within zones?
4. How wide should transition zones be?

## Expected Outputs
- Transition zone design patterns for GoDig layers
- Recommendations for visual/mechanical blending
- 'Zone approaching' indicator design
