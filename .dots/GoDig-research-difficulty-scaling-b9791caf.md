Research how to keep early areas challenging after players have mastered the game.

## Context
Hades 2 found that after a few dozen runs, Erebus 'started to feel a bit too easy.' Their solution: spawn new, tougher foes in completed areas.

## Questions to Answer
1. How does GoDig currently scale difficulty by depth?
2. What indicators show a player has 'mastered' early areas?
3. Should we spawn harder blocks/enemies, or add new mechanics?
4. How do other mining games handle this (Terraria hard mode)?
5. Risk: alienating returning players vs boring experienced players

## Research Sources
- Terraria hardmode mechanics
- Spelunky 2 daily challenge system
- Hades 2 difficulty scaling approach
- Dome Keeper wave difficulty
- Dead Cells difficulty cells system

## Expected Output
- Analysis of mastery indicators
- Recommendations for GoDig scaling approach
- implement: dot for chosen approach
