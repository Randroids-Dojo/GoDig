## Purpose

Research how action-focused games handle inventory management without breaking flow, especially on mobile.

## Research Questions

1. How do action games provide quick inventory access?
2. What's the balance between inventory depth and accessibility?
3. How do mobile games handle equipment/item switching?
4. What inventory UI patterns work for touch?
5. How do games handle full inventory gracefully?

## Games to Study
- Terraria mobile (touch inventory)
- Minecraft mobile (hotbar design)
- Don't Starve (pocket system)
- Stardew Valley (quick slots)
- Legend of Zelda (item wheels)

## GoDig Application
- Ladder quick-placement
- Inventory panel accessibility
- Full inventory handling
- Item usage during mining
- Sell flow optimization
