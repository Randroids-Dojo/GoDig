close-reason: Integrated EnemyManager with DirtGrid for depth-gated spawns. Added peaceful_mode setting to SettingsManager. Enemies now spawn when breaking blocks at appropriate depths. Added integration tests for enemy system.

EnemyManager exists but is basic stub. Design and implement: enemy types, spawn rules, combat mechanics, drops. Consider for v1.1.
