Analyze how survival and roguelite games implement mid-run safe zones without undermining tension. Study: (1) Don't Starve's Oasis/Caves bases, (2) Subnautica's cyclops/base mechanics, (3) Noita's Holy Mountains, (4) Spelunky's shortcuts. Focus on balancing recovery vs momentum, preventing exploitation, and maintaining session pacing. Output: Docs/research/underground-rest-stations.md
