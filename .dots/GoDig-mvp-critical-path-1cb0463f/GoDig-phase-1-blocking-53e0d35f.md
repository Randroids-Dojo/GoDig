Must decide before coding: chunk size, fuel mechanic, currency type, crafting yes/no

## Resolution Summary

All blocking decisions have been made and archived:
- **Chunk size**: 16x16 tiles per chunk (standard, good mobile performance)
- **Fuel mechanic**: No fuel for MVP (inventory pressure + fall damage creates tension)
- **Currency**: Single currency (coins) + crafting materials for upgrades
- **Crafting**: No crafting system, pure buy/sell model for MVP
