## Purpose

Investigate the unique rhythm of games with vertical descent and ascent cycles. GoDig's core loop is dig down, then return up - this creates distinct pacing patterns.

## Questions to Research

1. How does Spelunky balance descent momentum with return pressure?
2. What makes the return trip engaging vs tedious in mining games?
3. How do games vary the descent/ascent rhythm over sessions?
4. What psychological effects does constant downward movement create?
5. How do games break up the down-up-down monotony?

## Sources to Check
- Spelunky level design analysis
- Dome Keeper rhythm analysis
- Getting Over It momentum psychology
- Vertical platformer design studies
- Gravity and player psychology research

## Output
Create Docs/research/vertical-rhythm-design.md with rhythm recommendations.
