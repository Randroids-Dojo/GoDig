- Steam discussions for competitor games
- BoardGameGeek for push-your-luck mechanics

### Design Principles to Track
- Core loop satisfaction
- Push-your-luck mechanics
- Mobile-specific UX patterns
- Monetization that doesn't frustrate

## Research Log

### Session 8 (2026-02-01)
**Mr. Mine Analysis**:
- Depth-based surprises key to engagement
- Fast satisfaction curve (minutes, not hours)
- Hybrid active/passive appeals to multiple playstyles
- Milestones tied to content unlocks, not just numbers

**Dome Keeper 2024-2025**:
- Hit 1M players - validates mining + defense loop
- Complaints: "too slow, repetitive, grindy"
- Mitigation: Quick-buy, elevator, procedural variety

### Session 9 (2026-02-01)
**Spelunky Risk Design Analysis**:
- Core insight: "game of information and decision-making, not execution"
- Every micro-decision has risk/reward calculation
- Risk management separates great games from good games
- Our ladder system creates similar meaningful decisions

**Push-Your-Luck Board Game Mechanics**:
- Self-balancing: deeper = better rewards but higher risk
- Gradual tension buildup (like Deep Sea Adventure) beats sudden bust
- Mathematical balance: ~80% success per moment for 50% overall bust
- Our gradual ladder depletion creates superior tension curve

**Mobile Onboarding 2025 Best Practices**:
- Progressive onboarding: one mechanic at a time
- "One-minute rule": win player's heart in first 60 seconds
- Tutorial levels should BE fun gameplay (Candy Crush)
- Never monetize before first upgrade

**"One More Run" Psychology**:
- Defeat + determination = addictive loop
- Every run teaches something new
- Meta-progression critical (Rogue Legacy pattern)
- Quick restart is essential

**Dome Keeper 2025-2026 Updates**:
- Multiplayer mode in development
- Artillery and Tesla domes add strategic variety
- Community feedback: gadget randomness being addressed
- Lesson: plan for post-launch economy tuning

**itch.io Mining Game Landscape**:
- Terminal Descent: idle mining robots - validates core loop
- Astropop: asteroid mining roguelike - space setting
- Veinrider: incremental journey into depths
- Competition growing but few do mobile well

### Session 10 (2026-02-01)

**Balatro Variable Reward System (GDCA 2025 Game of the Year)**:
- Exponential growth via multipliers creates "making numbers go up" satisfaction
- Variable ratio reinforcement: uncertainty keeps players engaged
- Randomness + player agency: "You cannot pay to win here. You have to learn how to use the chaos."
- Meta-progression: even failures yield permanent rewards
- **GoDig Application**: Each block mined is a micro-uncertainty moment. Ore discovery parallels card draw excitement.

**Terraria Biome Discovery Lessons**:
- 64M+ copies sold - biome priority system creates exploration tension
- Evil biomes (Corruption/Crimson) spread and infect - creates dynamic world
- Board game adaptation uses tile-based world generation for replayability
- **GoDig Application**: Our 7 layers serve as "biomes" - each should have distinct visual/mechanical identity

**Cozy Mining Games & Casual Market (2025)**:
- Casual games: $24.2B in 2025, 31% of global downloads
- 45+ demographic fastest growing, drawn to cozy simulations
- 70% likelihood upcoming mining games will blend with management elements
- Forager: "fast-paced loop makes mining feel satisfying"
- **GoDig Application**: Our active mining is differentiated from idle games - but we can learn from cozy pacing

**Haptic Feedback Best Practices (iOS/Android)**:
- iOS significantly outperforms Android for haptic quality/control
- Marvel Snap example: "feel the weight of each move" creates memorable interactions
- Haptics must sync precisely with visuals - even small delays feel unnatural
- Reserve custom haptic patterns for high-value scenarios (ore discovery, upgrades)
- **GoDig Implementation**: Add haptic feedback for ore discovery (short burst), upgrade celebration (longer rumble), ladder placement (subtle tap)

**One-Hand Mobile Controls Research**:
- 49-75% of smartphone users operate one-handed
- "Subway Thumb" is most casual grip - game must support this
- 59% of users disengage if controls are physically uncomfortable
- Green zone (easy reach) vs yellow (manageable) vs red (hard) - design for thumb arc
- **GoDig Application**: Dig controls are already tap-based. HUD elements must be in thumb-reachable zones.

**Hades 2 Progression Pacing (Metacritic 94/100)**:
- Early Access used to tune balance based on player feedback
- Boons rebalanced: "Rare and Epic feel even more special now"
- New foes spawn in completed areas to maintain challenge
- Ending reworked based on player feedback post-launch
- **GoDig Lesson**: Plan for post-launch economy tuning. Start with generous progression, tighten later.

**Idle Game Monetization 2025**:
- Rewarded videos = 60-70% of idle game revenue
- Best practice: don't front-load monetization - wait until Day 3
- "Ads that bail players out, not slow them down" = 42% engagement (vs 25-30% average)
- Hybrid models work: ads + IAPs + battle passes
- **GoDig Application**: First upgrade free, monetization gates only after player is invested

**Dome Keeper 2025 Community Feedback**:
- Assessor character complaints: "too much downtime waiting"
- Players want rhythm variation: "If pressure is always max, it's just exhausting"
- Developer response: community feedback integral to development success
- Versus mode in development: competing teams on shared mine
- **GoDig Learning**: Vary tension rhythm - surface visits should provide genuine relief

**itch.io Mining Games 2025**:
- Terminal Descent: "Mine, drill, blast to deepest depths" - validates incremental core loop
- Space Miner: asteroid mining clicker - casual/strategy hybrid
- PlanetCore: drill + survive + upgrade missions
- Mine is Life: 2025 game jam entry - fresh competition emerging
- **Competitive Position**: GoDig's ladder-based risk system is unique differentiator

### Session 11 (2026-02-01)

**Vampire Survivors - Gambling Psychology Applied Successfully**:
- Creator Luca Galante applied gambling industry experience to game design
- Result: "distils the essence of compelling, just-one-more-go game design"
- PENS Model: Games fulfill competence (power/mastery) and autonomy (freedom)
- Minimal input (directional only) but maximum feedback (constant visual rewards)
- **GoDig Application**: Our tap-to-dig is simple; feedback (particles, sounds, toasts) must be rich

**Mining Game Grindiness - The Player Feedback Spectrum**:
- Keep on Mining (2025): "dopamine-inducing early, repetitive mid-game" - pacing issue
- Deep Rock Galactic Survivor: "best loop mechanically" but exponential scaling ruins late game
- Super Mining Mechs: "If digging isn't satisfying by itself, the game isn't for you"
- Hytale: Developer publicly stated mining "isn't fun enough" - they're fixing it
- Key insight: Mining must be inherently satisfying BEFORE any systems/upgrades

**What Makes Mining Satisfying (Forum Consensus)**:
- Deep Rock Galactic: "digging away and finding caverns etc is so much fun"
- Stardew Valley: time limits + enemies + shortcuts + bombs = variety
- SteamWorld Dig 2: "frequently mentioned as standout" for upgrade feel
- **Common thread**: Discovery and exploration, not just extraction

**Cult of the Lamb - Two-Loop Retention**:
- Dungeon crawling feeds base building, base building motivates dungeons
- Forgiving death: lose "a little bit of progress" not everything
- "Brilliant entry point to roguelites" - accessibility praised
- **GoDig Application**: Our surface/underground loops feed each other similarly

**Push-Your-Luck: Deep Sea Adventure Model**:
- Players share single oxygen supply - greed affects everyone
- Taking treasure = slowing return + draining shared resource
- "Incredible moment of anticipation" when decisions revealed
- **GoDig Application**: Our ladder depletion is gradual like oxygen - BETTER than sudden bust

**Mobile Session Reality (2025 Data)**:
- Median session: 4-6 minutes (not 15-30 as often assumed)
- Players average 4-6 sessions daily, 3-5 min each
- 80% of players churn by Day 1 - retention is critical
- First session 10-20 minutes is vital for F2P success
- **GoDig Application**: Design for 5-minute complete loops, hook within 2 minutes

**SteamWorld Dig 2 Addiction Analysis**:
- "Gameplay loop of dungeon crawler - little progress each outing, always gathering rewards"
- "Price/benefits of items well-tuned" - creates "just a few more coins" feeling
- "Impeccably paced - new powers when comfortable" - timing matters
- Upgrade impact: "Tier 1 vs Tier 3 should feel like night and day"

**Motherload Tedium Problem**:
- "Repetition of going up and down gets increasingly tedious"
- "Best part is upgrading, everything in between is grind"
- Mitigation: underground stations charge more but save time
- **GoDig Application**: Need late-game infrastructure (elevator) to prevent tedium

### Session 12 (2026-02-01)

**Slay the Spire Metrics-Driven Design (GDC Vault)**:
- Sold 1M+ copies first year, 3M+ on Steam with 97% positive rating
- "Metrics-driven design and balance" - heavy data usage throughout Early Access
- Community feedback integral to balance while maintaining game feel
- Key insight: "Allowing for combos and strong synergies is a hallmark of their design"
- Weekly updates during 14-month Early Access - iteration matters

**Loop Hero Idle/Active Hybrid Design**:
- "Brilliant combination of idle design with persistence and run focus of roguelite"
- "Commit or retreat" method creates meaningful decisions
- Resource retention varies by exit: die=30%, early retreat=60%, camp=100%
- Won Best Foreign Mobile Game at 2025 Pegases Awards
- Criticism: "On the hard side due to RNG and grinding required"

**Vertical Slice Best Practices (GDC 2025)**:
- "Becoming more important than ever" for publisher attention (Playstack - publishers of Balatro)
- "Make First 10 Seconds Count" - bold visual, sound tone, player control quickly
- Player validation data critical: "30-40% completed feedback surveys"
- "Core mechanic produces repeatable fun across multiple playtests"

**Mining Game "Feel" 2025 Consensus**:
- Hytale dev: "Mining isn't fun enough" - reworking audiovisual feel
- Deep Rock Galactic: "digging away and finding caverns is so much fun"
- SteamWorld Dig: "best platforming mechanics not made by Nintendo"
- Stardew Valley: time limits + enemies + shortcuts + bombs = variety
- Key: Discovery and exploration, not just extraction

**Mobile Game Economy First 5 Minutes**:
- 62% of players abandon due to lack of currency/resources (GameAnalytics)
- Dual currency (soft/hard) in 78% of successful titles
- "Layered approach perfect for mobile" - 5 min bus ride or 1 hour session
- Warning: "Too generous = blast through content, too stingy = frustrated quit"
- 30% increase in engagement from steady reward tapering

**Motherload Underground Stations**:
- "Stations at various levels underground so don't have to go all the way back up"
- They charge more (justified as transport cost)
- First "screw this game" moment: tedium of return trip
- Solution appears as REWARD: "underground outpost appears as a reward"
- **GoDig Application**: Elevator unlock should feel like achievement, not purchase

**Risk vs Reward Psychology**:
- Board games teach: "thrill of enormous success + devastation of losing all"
- Push-your-luck is DISTINCT from pure luck - requires meaningful CHOICES
- Incan Gold: self-balancing (fewer players = greater reward)
- "Good tension: I wish I could do both but must choose"
- "Bad frustration: I can't do anything meaningful"

**First Upgrade Hook Psychology**:
- "First few rounds feel tedious as characters move slowly"
- "Players who prove patience won't go unrewarded"
- "Satisfaction of seeing hero improve keeps players glued"
- Mobile: 40% session length increase when controls mastered in 5 min
- Critical: First upgrade must be FELT immediately

### Session 13 (2026-02-01)

**Deep Sea Adventure: The Gold Standard for Shared Resource Tension**:
- Core mechanic: All players share a single oxygen supply (starts at 25)
- Taking treasure = oxygen drains faster + movement slows (double punishment for greed)
- "If one dives too deep, other divers' lives will be on the line"
- Social tension: "convincing people not to take treasure if you're too far from submarine"
- Chain reaction: "if one person picks up then everyone else almost always follows"
- **GoDig Application**: Our ladder depletion creates similar gradual tension, but SOLO (no social blame). This is BETTER for mobile - player only blames themselves.

**The Return Journey Problem (Dome Keeper / Motherload)**:
- Dome Keeper: "Mining underground is strangely peaceful... but tension always hangs in background"
- Motherload: "Repetition of going up and down gets increasingly tedious"
- Solution: Gadgets that make return easier (Lift, Teleporter) unlock as REWARDS
- Dome Keeper Lift: "cut down time to go from mines to dome exponentially"
- **GoDig Critical Insight**: The return trip is where FUN can die. Must balance:
  1. Early game: Wall-jump + ladders = skill expression, feels clever
  2. Mid-game: Elevator unlock = reward for investment
  3. Late-game: Teleport scroll = emergency bailout (premium feel)

**Push-Your-Luck Board Game Design (BoardGameGeek Analysis)**:
- Core tension: "stop or keep going - get too greedy, end up with nothing"
- Self-balancing: "fewer players still in = greater their potential reward"
- Best games: Quacks of Quedlinburg (bag-building + push), Flip 7 (Spiel des Jahres 2025 nominee)
- Deep Sea Adventure: 2015 Game Market Prize winner - validates shared tension model
- **GoDig Unique Angle**: Solo ladder economy = all tension, no social blame

**SteamWorld Dig Pickaxe Satisfaction Analysis**:
- "When you get that newest upgrade so you can dig through each block with only one hit, it's immensely satisfying"
- Sound design critical: "tinkling noise becomes clearer with higher tempo with every subsequent hit"
- Progression criticism: upgrades are "boringly straightforward" (just stat increases)
- **GoDig Improvement**: Each tier should have VISUAL/AUDIO differences, not just faster

**Power Progression Psychology**:
- "Understanding the psychology behind power progression helps create experiences that resonate"
- Balance intrinsic (mastery) vs extrinsic (rewards) motivation
- Dopamine: "each time user achieves something exciting, brain releases dopamine"
- Power creep danger: "new content must be challenging, but makes older content boring"
- **GoDig Solution**: Horizontal progression later (cosmetics, automation) not just vertical

**Just One More Run Psychology (2025 Analysis)**:
- "Endless loop of defeat and determination has made roguelikes one of the most addictive genres"
- Quick runs matter: "games where runs are pretty quick help because you can go from doing great to dead fast"
- Nuclear Throne: "great because it's quick - you can get to the Throne in less than ten minutes"
- Risk of Rain 2: "item drops turn into stacking frenzy of busted combinations"
- **GoDig Target**: 5-minute complete loop (dig -> sell -> upgrade) enables "one more run"

**Idle Miner Tycoon Economy Design**:
- "Upgrades feel rewarding... love how fast the progression feels without forcing you to spend money"
- Core satisfaction: "return-from-idle" animation showing idle cash earned
- Prestige system: "resets progress but gives permanent multiplier"
- "Satisfying loop where small actions support big goals"
- **GoDig Inspiration**: Surface visits = our "return from idle" moment (even though active)

**Sell Animation Psychology**:
- "Accumulated coin piles accompanied by sparkling sounds evoke feelings of achievement"
- "Vivid visuals—shining coins, flashing lights—amplify perceived reward"
- Short-term rewards: "immediate feedback, coin or sound effect after completing task"
- "Ideally awards should be made immediately... player quickly confirms competence"
- **GoDig Implementation**: Selling ore needs SATISFYING coin cascade animation + sound

**Roguelite Time Pressure Design**:
- "Time-based clock prods player along, imposes cost on spending too long"
- "Leaving good players without time pressure invites optimal tedium"
- 20-30 minute ideal run length for roguelites, but mobile is different
- "Every roguelite has a period during a run where it starts feeling like a chore"
- **GoDig Solution**: Natural stopping points (surface return) prevent chore feeling

### Session 14 (2026-02-01)

**Deep Rock Galactic Extraction Phase Design**:
- Extraction creates "satisfying tension" - players must backtrack to escape pod once objective is complete
- Community debates: time limit (30 seconds) feels punishing when pod spawns far away
- Deep Rock Galactic Survivor: Phase 5 extraction timer criticized as redundant after boss kill
- Season 6 (Q1 2026) introduces "Heavy Extraction" mission type with booster rockets
- Lift gadget "exponentially cuts return time" - critical for late-game usability
- 90% positive (17,000+ reviews) validates mine-defend-extract core loop
- **GoDig Application**: Our surface return isn't timed, but ladder depletion creates similar pressure. Elevator unlock should mirror DRG's Lift satisfaction.

**Cozy Game Design: Safe Zone Principles (Gamasutra)**:
- Coziness = safety + abundance + softness (lower stress, needs met, gentle stimuli)
- Distinct thresholds between dangerous/safe spaces heighten relief (snowstorm → cabin)
- Protection signals: sleeping pets, relaxed guardians, warm tones, enclosed spaces
- Mundanity matters: familiar settings (tea rooms, pantries) cozier than exotic ones
- Focus through elimination: no interruptions, intimate framing, knowable space
- Undertale cited: warm tones + relaxed guardian + focused interior = safe haven
- **GoDig Application**: Surface should have warm colors, enclosed shop interiors, no threats visible. Underground should feel increasingly unfamiliar.

**Noita Physics-Based Destruction**:
- "Every pixel is physically simulated" - 95% positive rating (45,499 reviews)
- Environmental destructibility is "key to appeal and greatest asset"
- Liquids pour/fill realistically - creates emergent problem-solving
- Chain reactions: burn wood → collapses → releases toxic sludge → erodes enemies
- Players describe "amazed by pretty pixels and physics" as initial hook
- "You can destroy the whole world if you wish" - player agency maximized
- **GoDig Application**: Our block destruction should feel impactful. Particle effects, debris falling, dust clouds. Each dig should feel like "making a mark on the world."

**Mobile Session End Celebrations (2025 Best Practices)**:
- Session-end rewards create "positive experience" - players feel appreciated
- Level completion events provide immediate rewards/recognition
- "Little 'you did it!' moments" via badges, trophies, animations boost retention
- Satisfying animations encourage return visits
- Game UI Database: over 1,300 games with 55,000 UI screenshots for reference
- Responsive animation feedback makes sequences "satisfying" and "organic"
- **GoDig Application**: After selling ore, need celebratory moment. After safe return from deep dive, need "you made it!" relief celebration.

**Mr. Mine - Idle Mining Progression (88% positive, 6,857 reviews)**:
- "Adventure and discovery" emphasized over pure incremental progress
- Each new depth introduces "rarer minerals, hidden structures, surprises"
- 100+ drill upgrades create constant progression milestones
- Progression unlocks: battles, reactors, caves, new worlds - content gates, not just numbers
- "Keeps players hooked through constant sense of discovery"
- **GoDig Lesson**: Depth should unlock NEW THINGS, not just harder blocks. Caves, treasures, secrets.

**Core Keeper Mining Progression (2025)**:
- Biome-based ore progression: Copper → Tin → Iron → Scarlet → Octarine → Galaxite
- "Each mining skill level increases mining damage by 1" - granular progression
- Automation via drills unlocks mid-game - first step into passive income
- Ore Boulders as "plentiful source" once drills available - reward for investment
- Crafting station prerequisites create natural gates: Tin Workbench → Iron Workbench
- "Points invested into perk trees may be refunded" - encourages experimentation
- **GoDig Application**: Our pickaxe tiers should have similar "can I mine this?" gating by depth.

**Roguelike Design Principles (2025 Synthesis)**:
- "Player themselves getting better" is the core hook - skill accumulates across runs
- Expert players have "higher-than-average chance at winning" despite same odds
- Near-instant restart after failure prevents antagonizing frustrated players
- "One more game" mentality = strong addiction factor
- "Satisfying and short gameplay loop" critical for repeated play (Hades cited)
- Permadeath adds "strong sense of consequences" - every action matters
- **GoDig Application**: Death should be quick + restart immediate. Our "emergency rescue" should feel like a consequence but not punishment.

**Dome Keeper 2025 Deep Dive**:
- Central tension: "do you risk delving deeper, or return to prepare for attack?"
- Lift gadget: "important boost late-game" for return trip efficiency
- Three resources (iron, water, cobalt) create "efficiency puzzle"
- 90% positive with 17,000+ reviews validates the mine-defend loop
- Multiplayer announced for 2026 - validates cooperative mining interest
- Xbox Game Pass December 2025 - broad audience appeal proven
- **GoDig Distinction**: No defense mechanic means pure push-your-luck on ladder economy

**Incremental Game Psychology: "Number Go Up"**:
- Core hook: "you click the cookie, you have a cookie, enough cookies net automatic gains"
- Shortcut to positive feedback loop - minimal friction to reward
- Genre exploding: "new games developed almost daily"
- Itch.io game tagline captures it: "Drop balls. Make money. Number go up. Happy."
- **GoDig Application**: Our ore count, coin count, depth record - all "numbers going up". Make each visible and satisfying.
