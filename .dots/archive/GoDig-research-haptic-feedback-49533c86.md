## Purpose
Research best practices for haptic feedback in mobile games, specifically for mining/digging mechanics.

## Background
Task GoDig-implement-haptic-feedback-92e67c42 needs to know when haptics add value vs. become annoying. Need to study:
- Successful haptic implementations in mobile games
- When players appreciate vibration vs. find it annoying
- Accessibility considerations (must be disableable)
- Battery impact of haptics
- Platform differences (iOS Taptic Engine vs Android vibration)

## Research Questions
1. Which actions benefit most from haptic feedback?
2. How often is too often for haptics?
3. What intensity levels work best?
4. How do other mining/digging games use haptics?
5. What accessibility guidelines exist for haptics?

## Expected Outputs
- Haptic feedback design guidelines for GoDig
- List of actions that should/shouldn't have haptics
- Intensity recommendations per action type
- Accessibility requirements
