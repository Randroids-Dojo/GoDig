close-reason: Covered by MonetizationManager - gates monetization until 3+ successful runs (dig-sell loops)

Critical for retention: No monetization/ads in first 3 complete dig-sell loops. D1 retention is where most retention is made - aggressive early monetization causes low retention. Target benchmarks: D1 45%+, D7 20%+, D30 10%+. Best practice: fewer ads at beginning, increase once players are hooked. Reference Session 29 retention research.
