## Purpose

Investigate how mining/underground games tell stories through environment rather than explicit narrative. Find techniques for GoDig's discoverable lore system.

## Questions to Research

1. How does Hollow Knight use environmental storytelling for lore delivery?
2. What techniques do Dark Souls/Elden Ring use for item descriptions and placement?
3. How does Outer Wilds create discovery-driven narrative underground?
4. What visual storytelling works in procedural environments?
5. How do games balance explicit vs implicit storytelling underground?

## Sources to Check
- Game Maker's Toolkit videos on environmental storytelling
- Hollow Knight lore analysis
- Dark Souls item placement design
- Outer Wilds design documentation
- Subnautica biome storytelling

## Output
Create Docs/research/environmental-storytelling-underground.md with techniques for implementing discoverable lore.
