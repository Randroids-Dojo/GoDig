# Depth Milestone Psychology Research

## Overview

Research into milestone design and achievement psychology. Understanding what makes reaching 500m feel like an achievement, how to communicate progress, and the optimal spacing between meaningful milestones.

## The Psychology of Achievements

### Why Milestones Feel Satisfying

> "The psychological impact of unlocking achievements includes a surge of dopamine—the brain's pleasure neurotransmitter."

**The Feedback Loop:**
1. Set goal (reach 500m)
2. Make progress (visible depth counter)
3. Achieve goal (celebration)
4. Dopamine release (satisfaction)
5. Set new goal (reach 600m)

**Key Insight:**
> "The gratification derived from achieving goals within a game mirrors real-world feelings of accomplishment."

### Self-Efficacy Effect

> "Hearing that a goal is possible for us makes us more likely to think we're capable of reaching it."

**For GoDig:** Showing other players' depth records ("Players have reached 2,000m!") increases belief that deeper depths are achievable.

### Social Dimensions

> "Achievements let gamers share evidence of their skill and persistence. They have to do with emotions of pride."

**Depth records are bragging rights** - Show personal bests, compare to friends, display badges.

## The Dark Souls Bonfire Effect

### Relief as Reward

> "A bonfire isn't just a means to save—it is a physical manifestation of relief."

**Why Bonfires Work:**
- Contrast with danger (tension → release)
- Visual/audio cues (crackling fire, warm glow)
- Safe space to rest and plan
- Checkpoint that validates progress

### The Tension-Release Cycle

```
Danger → Survival → Danger → Survival → MILESTONE →
(Relief, Celebration, Dopamine) → Reset → Deeper Danger
```

> "Players often report being more happy when they find a bonfire than when they beat a boss."

**For GoDig:** Reaching surface with loot = bonfire moment. Reaching depth milestones = major relief.

### Emotional Weight of Checkpoints

> "In a game where death comes easily, a checkpoint holds a lot of emotional weight. Dark Souls' placement of bonfires is masterful—always coming at the perfect time."

**Design Principle:** Milestones should come when players need validation, not on arbitrary schedules.

## Milestone Spacing & Frequency

### Avoid Achievement Spam

> "One of the worst things you can do is create achievement spam. Space out achievements into groups."

**Bad Design:**
- "Reached 10m!" (too frequent)
- "Reached 20m!" (meaningless)
- "Reached 30m!" (annoying)

**Good Design:**
- First ore discovery (meaningful moment)
- First return to surface (loop completion)
- 100m depth (major milestone)
- 500m depth (significant achievement)

### Match Celebration to Achievement

> "Duolingo excels by matching celebration to achievement. Completing first lesson gets quick congratulations. 365-day streak triggers major celebration."

**Celebration Tiers:**

| Achievement | Celebration Level | Example |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Minor | Brief acknowledgment | "+1 coal" text popup |
| Moderate | Visual feedback | Coin cascade animation |
| Major | Full celebration | Screen flash, sound, popup |
| Epic | Extended celebration | New content unlocked screen |

### Milestone Spacing Formula

> "Each milestone should be close enough that you feel motivated to push towards it."

**Recommended Spacing for Depth:**

| Milestone | Spacing | Why This Works |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 0-100m | Every 25m | Learning phase, frequent validation |
| 100-500m | Every 100m | Established player, significant goals |
| 500-1000m | Every 250m | Veteran, major achievements |
| 1000m+ | Every 500m | Mastery, rare accomplishments |

## Meaningful Milestones

### What Makes a Milestone Meaningful

> "Milestones should be meaningful and tangible. By having meaningful milestones, you get a feeling of accomplishment. By having tangible milestones, you get a feeling of progress."

**Meaningful = Tied to Game Events:**
- First of something (first ore, first upgrade)
- Completion of loop (dig → sell → upgrade)
- New content unlocked (new layer, new shop)
- Personal best beaten (depth record)

**Tangible = Clear Benefit:**
- New area accessible
- New item unlocked
- New ability gained
- Permanent bonus earned

### The Mystery Box Effect

> "The best results occur when the reward is unpredictable—like a Mystery Box or Easter Egg. The player knows the milestone but doesn't know the reward."

**For GoDig:** At 500m, reveal what's unlocked:
- "New: Deep Stone Layer"
- "New: Platinum Ore"
- "New: Drill unlocked at Blacksmith"
- "Achievement: Deep Diver"

### Progress Tracking

> "Clear progress tracking enhances the sense of achievement and motivates players to continue."

**Show:**
- Current depth
- Personal best depth
- Next milestone depth
- % progress to next milestone

## Personal Best Psychology

### Why PRs Motivate

> "Achieving a personal best serves as tangible proof of capabilities, often leading to a positive feedback loop where success breeds more success."

**The PR Effect:**
1. Beat previous best
2. Feel competent
3. Believe deeper is possible
4. Attempt deeper
5. Beat new record

### Celebration After PRs

> "After achieving a PR, it's important to celebrate to help yourself feel successful."

**But with caution:**
> "Don't celebrate so much that you avoid the activity, fearing you'll do worse next time."

**Balance:** Celebrate the record, but immediately show "Can you reach [next target]?"

### Self-Efficacy Building

> "Self-efficacy—the belief in one's capabilities—determines how goals are set, how effort is mobilized, and how setbacks are perceived."

**Design Implication:** Show that deeper depths are achievable:
- "Your best: 350m"
- "Average player best: 400m"
- "Next milestone: 500m"
- "What's at 500m: [preview of new content]"

## Feedback Design

### Positive vs Negative Feedback

> "Positive feedback satisfies competence and autonomy needs. Negative feedback motivates short-term performance repair, while positive feedback fosters long-term motivation."

**For Deaths:**
- Don't: "You died! Lost 500 coins!"
- Do: "Good run! Reached 320m. Your best is 350m."

**For Milestones:**
- Don't: Silent unlock
- Do: Full celebration with clear message

### Immediate vs Delayed Feedback

> "Feedback is more effective when presented close in time to the event being evaluated."

**Depth Milestones:**
- The moment you pass 500m, celebrate
- Don't wait until return to surface
- Show progress in real-time

## Recommendations for GoDig

### Milestone Structure

**Core Depth Milestones:**

| Depth | Name | Unlock | Celebration |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| 25m | First Steps | Nothing | Brief popup |
| 50m | Getting Started | Topsoil layer complete | Sound + popup |
| 100m | Miner | Subsoil layer | Full celebration |
| 250m | Spelunker | Stone layer visible | Celebration + preview |
| 500m | Deep Diver | Drill unlock, Platinum | Major celebration |
| 750m | Veteran | Crystal layer visible | Full celebration |
| 1000m | Master | Magma layer, Void hint | Epic celebration |
| 2000m | Legend | Void layer | Achievement + cosmetic |

### Personal Best Tracking

**Display Always:**
- Current depth (bottom of screen)
- Best depth (on death screen, in stats)
- Best depth this session (on return)

**Celebrate PRs:**
- "New Personal Best!" popup when beaten
- Show improvement amount
- Immediately suggest next target

### Layer Transitions as Milestones

**Use layer changes as natural milestones:**
- Visual change (dirt → stone)
- New music/ambience
- Brief "Entering: Stone Layer" overlay
- Pause for player to appreciate

### Celebration Scaling

**Match celebration to achievement:**

| Event | Visual | Audio | Duration |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| +10m depth | None | None | - |
| New PR (small) | Brief flash | Chime | 0.5s |
| Major milestone | Screen celebration | Fanfare | 2s |
| New layer entry | Overlay text | Transition music | 1s |
| Epic milestone | Full screen | Special fanfare | 3s |

### Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Too frequent** - Celebration fatigue
2. **Too rare** - Players feel lost
3. **Inconsistent** - Arbitrary feeling
4. **Overpromising** - "500m!" but nothing new
5. **Undercelebrating** - Major milestone, minor popup

### The "Almost There" Preview

**At 80% to next milestone:**
- "450m - 50m to Deep Diver achievement!"
- Creates motivation for push
- Makes milestone feel earned, not arbitrary
