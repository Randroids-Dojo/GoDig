## Purpose

Research how successful games detect player frustration and offer assistance without breaking immersion or feeling condescending.

## Research Questions

1. How do games detect player frustration? (death count, time spent, repeated failures)
2. What help mechanisms feel empowering vs patronizing?
3. How do roguelites balance challenge with accessibility (Celeste Assist Mode, Hades God Mode)
4. What's the right timing for offering help?
5. How does GoDig's ladder system interact with stuck states?

## Games to Study
- Celeste (Assist Mode design)
- Hades (God Mode implementation)
- Cuphead (post-failure assists)
- Dead Cells (accessibility options)
- Shovel Knight (checkpoints)

## GoDig Application
- When to offer emergency rescue
- How to frame 'forfeit cargo' without shame
- Tutorial hints vs player-requested help
- Stuck detection and recovery nudges

## Deliverable
