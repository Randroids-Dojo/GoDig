Create visual depth progression through color. Surface: warm, saturated colors (safety/comfort). Underground: progressively desaturated, cooler tones. Deep: alien/uncomfortable blues/purples. Inspired by Animal Well (reduced palette = depth/eerie vibe), Inmost (desaturated blues/grays), Subnautica (visual discomfort progression). Reference Session 30 pixel art and Subnautica research.
