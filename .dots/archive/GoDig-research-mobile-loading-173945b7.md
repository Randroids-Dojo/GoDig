## Purpose

Research how mobile games make loading feel faster and maintain engagement during necessary waits.

## Research Questions

1. What loading screen strategies keep players engaged?
2. How do games use progressive loading to get players playing faster?
3. What's the psychology behind loading bars and spinners?
4. How do games hide loading behind gameplay transitions?
5. What makes wait times feel acceptable vs frustrating?

## Games to Study
- Clash Royale (instant loading illusions)
- Pokemon GO (AR warm-up disguising load)
- Subway Surfers (animated tips)
- Candy Crush (level loading transitions)
- Genshin Impact (domain loading)

## GoDig Application
- Chunk loading perception
- Scene transition design
- Save/load feedback
- Return-to-surface transitions
- Shop scene loading

## Deliverable
