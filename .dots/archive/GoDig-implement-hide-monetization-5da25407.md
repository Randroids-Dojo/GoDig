Based on mobile game psychology research (Session 26), games like Head Ball 2 don't show IAPs to new users at all initially. D1 retention is where most retention is made. First upgrade must be achievable quickly AND feel transformative. No IAPs shown until player has experienced full dig-sell-upgrade loop.
