Research how roguelites maintain late-game engagement through sidegrades rather than pure stat increases. Topics: 1) Binding of Isaac item variety and synergies, 2) Hades boon choices and builds, 3) Enter the Gungeon weapon variety, 4) How to avoid 'solved meta' problem, 5) Meaningful choices vs stat sticks. Output: Docs/research/sidegrade-economy.md for late-game upgrade system design.
