## Purpose

Investigate how mining games can use audio to convey gameplay information for accessibility. Important for players with visual impairments or those playing while multitasking.

## Questions to Research

1. What audio cues indicate proximity to valuable resources?
2. How do games use spatial audio for underground navigation?
3. What accessibility options exist for audio-only play?
4. How do rhythm-based audio cues support blind players?
5. What audio design makes digging feel satisfying without visuals?

## Sources to Check
- Accessibility in games database (DAGER)
- Can I Play That? reviews of mining games
- Audio Games research
- SteamWorld Dig audio design
- Minecraft audio accessibility mods

## Output
Create Docs/research/audio-accessibility-mining.md with accessibility recommendations.
