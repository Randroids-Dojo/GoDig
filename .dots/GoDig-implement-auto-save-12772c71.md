Implement auto-save system that saves every 30 seconds and on key events (ore collected, return to surface, upgrade purchased). Support instant resume to exact game state. 70% of players prefer resuming from last action without downtime. Use tiered saving: player progress continuous, secondary elements less frequent. Reference Session 29 save state research.
