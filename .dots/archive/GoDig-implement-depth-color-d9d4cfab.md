close-reason: Implemented by depth palette system (GoDig-implement-depth-palette-92a488d3) - all layers now have warm-to-cold, saturated-to-desaturated color progression

Create visual depth progression through color. Surface: warm, saturated colors (safety/comfort). Underground: progressively desaturated, cooler tones. Deep: alien/uncomfortable blues/purples. Inspired by Animal Well (reduced palette = depth/eerie vibe), Inmost (desaturated blues/grays), Subnautica (visual discomfort progression). Reference Session 30 pixel art and Subnautica research.
