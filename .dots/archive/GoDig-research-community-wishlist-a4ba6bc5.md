Ongoing task: Search Reddit, Discord, Steam forums, Twitter for what players want in mining games. What features do they request? What frustrations do they mention? Create new research/implementation tasks based on findings. This is an evergreen task - never truly complete.

## Research Session: 2026-01-19

### What Players Love in Mining Games

**Core Loop Satisfaction (SteamWorld Dig, Motherload, Mr. Mine)**
- The dig -> collect -> return -> sell -> upgrade -> dig deeper loop is inherently satisfying
- Sense of progression: "At no point is there a feeling that no progress is being made"
- Creating your own path/puzzles - SteamWorld Dig's "inverted y-axis platformer" where you create your own pathways
- Strategic planning: "Each step you make must be calculated - how to get down AND how to get up"
- The thrill of discovering rare resources and secrets
- Zen gameplay that can be enjoyed solo or with friends

**Design Lessons from SteamWorld Dig**
- "The best design is where the game becomes better from the developers being lazy" - constraints improve gameplay
- Preventing diagonal upward digging adds meaningful danger of getting stuck
- Balance between managing resources, chasing upgrades, and light story
- Simple to jump into, complex enough to keep thinking

**Motherload Success Factors**
- Fuel management creates tension and decision-making
- Upgrade progression (fuel tank, cargo, drill, engine, hull, radiator)
- Hidden dangers: gas pockets, earthquakes, environmental surprises
- The quest for the "Motherload" - a clear goal to chase

### What Players Hate (Mobile Idle Games)

**Energy/Timer Systems**
- "Energy systems suck" - universally disliked
- 2-hour idle time limits frustrate players
- Waiting 20-30 minutes for lives feels manipulative
- "The 'idle' label is deceptive - almost zero progress while away"
- Lesson: If we have any pacing mechanic, frame it as a BONUS, not a restriction

**Predatory Monetization**
- "$20 for just one manager? $10 to remove ads?" - insane pricing
- "Pay-to-complete" events that require spending money
- Rigged reward systems ("lowest prize 5 days in a row")
- 2-minute unskippable ads that steal player time
- Performance lag after watching ads

**Fake Idle Games**
- Games that punish you for closing them
- Mining speeds drastically reduced when app is backgrounded
- False advertising about being "idle"

### Positive Monetization Examples

**What Works**
- One-time premium purchase (Stardew Valley, Monument Valley, Minecraft)
- Cosmetic-only microtransactions (Among Us) - no gameplay advantage
- Limited-time/seasonal cosmetics create urgency without pay-to-win
- Battle passes with cosmetic rewards
- Ad removal as one-time purchase
- Expansion packs for substantial content

**Key Principle**: All players should have opportunities to acquire items, even if slower

### Tasks Created From This Research

- Already have: No energy/fuel system (decided earlier)
- Already have: Single-currency system (no predatory multi-currency)
- Need to verify: Offline progress should be POSITIVE, not punishing
- Need to verify: Any limited-time content should be cosmetic-only

### Future Research Areas

- Deep dive into successful premium mobile games (Monument Valley, The Room)
- Research battle pass systems that respect players
- Investigate what cosmetics mining game players would actually want
- Study session length patterns for mobile mining games
